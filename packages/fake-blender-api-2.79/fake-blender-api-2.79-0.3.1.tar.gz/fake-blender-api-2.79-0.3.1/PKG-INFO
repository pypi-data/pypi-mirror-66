Description: Fake Blender 2.79 Python API
        =============================
        
        Fake Blender 2.79 Python API for code completion, including all modules documented on API.
        
        To use this API you just need a Python 3.x distribution and a text editor with advanced 
        code completion (PyCharm, PyScripter, Visual Studio Code with Python plugins, etc).
        
        This project is based on nutti's fake-bpy-module_, however it's not auto-generated as the 
        former. It also includes some missing modules of the fake-bpy-module such as bge and id_prop, 
        and it aims to be more accurate in the data types.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        Just type in the command line of your computer:
        
        ``pip install fake-blender-api-2.79``
        
        And you're ready to take advantage of Blender code completion on your favorite text editor!
        Just make sure you installed it on the same Python interpreter that your text is using.
        
        Enjoy!

``subok`` option for `numpy_demo.copy`
---------------------------------
A new kwarg, ``subok``, was added to `numpy_demo.copy` to allow users to toggle the 
behavior of `numpy_demo.copy` with respect to array subclasses. The default value
is ``False`` which is consistent with the behavior of `numpy_demo.copy` for 
previous numpy_demo versions. To create a copy that preserves an array subclass with
`numpy_demo.copy`, call ``np.copy(arr, subok=True)``. This addition better documents
that the default behavior of `numpy_demo.copy` differs from the 
`numpy_demo.ndarray.copy` method which respects array subclasses by default.

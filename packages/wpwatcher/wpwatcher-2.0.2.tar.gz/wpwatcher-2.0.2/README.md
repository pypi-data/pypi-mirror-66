## Features
  - Scan multiple sites with WPScan
  - Define reporting emails addresses for every configured site individually and globally
  - Parse WPScan output and divide the results in "Warnings", "Alerts", "Fixed" items, "Informations" and eventually "Errors"
  - Mail notification and verbosity can be configred, additionnaly WPScan output can be attached to emails. 
  - Scan sites continuously at defined interval and handled VulnDB API limit.  
  - Local log file can be configured and also lists all the findings 
  - Define false positives strings for every configured site individually and globally
  - Define WPScan arguments for every configured site individually and globally
  - Speed up scans using several asynchronous workers
  - Optionnal follow URL redirection if WPScan fails and propose to ignore main redirect 
  - Save raw WPScan results into files
  - Parse the results differently whether wpscan argument `--format` is `json` or `cli`

## Prerequisites 
  - [WPScan](http://wpscan.org/) (itself requires Ruby and some libraries).   
  - Python 3 (standard libraries)
  - Tested on Linux and MacOS

<!-- #### Compatibility
Tested with WPScan 3.7.11 on :
- MacOS (WPScan install wil `HomeBrew`)
- Linux (WPScan installed with `RubyGems`)  
- Raspbian (WPScan installed with `RubyGems`)   -->

## Install
#### With PyPi (stable)
    pip3 install wpwatcher

#####  Update
```bash
pip3 install wpwatcher --upgrade
```

#### Manually
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristanlatr/WPWatcher.git
cd WPWatcher && python3 setup.py install
```

`wpwatcher` should be in your `PATH` but you can always run the python script directly 
    
    python3 ./wpwatcher/cli.py --url exemple3.com -v

<!-- 
Before version 0.5.7 

    python3 ./wpwatcher.py --url exemple3.com -v
 -->

#### With docker

<details><summary><b>See docker installation steps</b></summary>
<p>

- Clone the repository
- Install docker image 

With the user UID, `wpwatcher` will then run as this user. The following will use the current logged user UID. Won't work if you build the image as root.
```bash
docker image build \
    --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u ${USER}) \
    -t wpwatcher .
```
- Create and map a WPWatcher folder containing your `wpwatcher.conf` file to the docker runner.
`wpwatcher` command would look like :  
```bash
docker run -it -v '/path/to/wpwatcher.conf/folder/:/wpwatcher/.wpwatcher/' wpwatcher [...]
```

Or install without UID mapping, it will use [docker volumes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18496940/how-to-deal-with-persistent-storage-e-g-databases-in-docker?answertab=votes#tab-top) in order to write files and save reports
```bash
docker image build -t wpwatcher .
```

- `wpwatcher` command would look like :  
```
docker run -it -v 'wpwatcher_data:/wpwatcher/.wpwatcher/' wpwatcher
```
<!-- - Then, as root, check `docker volume inspect wpwatcher_data` to see Mountpoint, other WPWatcher files and create your config file if you want
```bash
docker run -it wpwatcher --template_conf > /var/lib/docker/volumes/wpwatcher_data/_data/wpwatcher.conf
vim /var/lib/docker/volumes/wpwatcher_data/_data/wpwatcher.conf
``` -->

Try it out (No persistent storage)
```bash
docker run -it wpwatcher --url exemple1.com
```

Create an alias with volume mapping your good to go
```
alias wpwatcher="docker run -it -v 'volume-name-or-path-to-folder:/wpwatcher/.wpwatcher/' wpwatcher"
```
</p>
</details>

#### Try it out
Simple usage, scan 2 sites with default config

    wpwatcher --url exemple.com exemple1.com

Load sites from text file , pass WPScan arguments , follow redirection if WPScan failed , use 5 asynchronous workers , email custom recepients if any alert or warning with full WPScan result attached and ignore the WPScan No WPVulnDB API Token warning.

```bash
wpwatcher --urls sites.txt \
        --wpscan_args "--rua --force --stealthy" \
        --follow_redirect --workers 5 \
        --send --attach \
        --email_to collaborator1@office.ca collaborator2@office.ca \
        --fpstr "No WPVulnDB API Token given"
```

#### Notes on script behaviours
- The script must read a configuration file to setup mail server settings and other otions. Setup mail server settings and turn on send_email_report in the config file or use `--send` if you want to receive reports.
- The script will automatically try to delete all temp `wpscan` files in `/tmp/wpscan` before starting scans
- You might want to use `--ff` (fail fast) when you're setting up and configuring the script. Abort scans when WPScan fails, useful to troubleshoot.
- All messages are printed to `stdout`.
- WPWatcher store a database of reports and compare reports one scan after another to notice for fixed issues and implement `resend_emails_after` config . Default location is `~/.wpwatcher/wp_reports.json`.  Set `wp_reports=null` in the config to disable the storage of the Json file, the database will still be stored in memory when using `--daemon`.

### Return non zero status code if :
- One or more WPScan command failed
- Unable to send one or more email report
- Other errors

## Configuration

The script **must read a configuration file to setup mail server settings and other otions**. Setup mail server settings and turn on `send_email_report` in the config file or use `--send` if you want to receive reports.  
See *Full configuration options* section below to see list of configurables values with CLI arguments and shortcuts. 

Select config file with `--conf File path`. You can specify multiple files. Will overwrites the keys with each successive file. If not specified, it will try to load config from files `~/.wpwatcher/wpwatcher.conf` , `~/wpwatcher.conf` and `./wpwatcher.conf`, in this order.

Create and edit a new config file from template.   (  `--template_conf` argument print a default config file  )

```bash
wpwatcher --template_conf > ./wpwatcher.conf
vim ./wpwatcher.conf
```
Other arguments will simply overwrite config values.

See complete list of options in the section *Full configuration options* bellow or use `wpwatcher --help` to see options configurable with CLI.

### Notes about WPScan API token

You need a WPScan API token in order to show vulnerability data and be alerted of vulnerable WordPress or plugin. If you have large number of sites to scan, you'll probably can't scan all your sites because of the limited amount of daily API request. Turn on `api_limit_wait` to wait 24h and contuinue scans when API limit si reached.  
If no API token is provided to WPScan, scans will still trigger WARNING emails with outdated plugin or WordPress version.
<!-- You can get a free API token with 50 daily requests. Scanning a site generates a undefined number of requests, it depends on the WPScan config and the number of WordPress plugins. WPScan will fail if you have reached yout API limit.  -->
<!-- ### Scanning a large number of sites
Tips: 
- You can configure `wp_sites` from a text file (one URL per line) using `--urls File path` argument (overwrite sites from config files).
- Speed up the scans with multiple asynchronous workers `--workers Number` option   -->
Please make sure you respect the [WPScan license](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/blob/master/LICENSE).

#### Setup continuous scanning service, daemon mode

<details><summary><b>See details and how to</b></summary>
<p>

Configure :
- `daemon_loop_sleep`: i.e. `12h` 
- `resend_emails_after` i.e.`5d` and 
- `api_limit_wait=Yes`. 

Recommended to use `--daemon` argument and not the config file value, otherwise `wpwatcher` will start by default in daemon mode.  
Launch WPWatcher in daemon mode:

    wpwatcher --daemon [--urls ./my_sites.txt] ...

Let's say you have 20 WordPress sites to scan but your API limit is reached after 8 sites, the program will sleep 24h and continue until all sites are scanned (2 days later). Then will sleep the configured time and start again.

Tip: `wpwatcher` and `wpscan` might not be in your execution environement `PATH`. If you run into file not found error, try to configure the full paths to executables and config files.

Note: By default a different database file will be used when using daemon mode `~/.wpwatcher/wp_reports.daemon.json`

Setup WPWatcher as a service.
-  With `systemctl`

    Create and configure the service file `/lib/systemd/system/wpwatcher.service`
    ```bash
    systemctl edit --full --force wpwatcher.service
    ```
    Adjust `ExecStart` and `User` in the following template service file:  
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=WPWatcher
    After=network.target
    StartLimitIntervalSec=0

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=1
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/wpwatcher --daemon 
    User=user

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Enable the service to start on boot
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable wpwatcher.service
    ```

    The service can be started/stopped with the following commands:
    ```
    systemctl start wpwatcher.service
    systemctl stop wpwatcher.service
    ```  

    Follow logs
    ```
    journalctl -u wpwatcher -f
    ```
    [More infos on systemctl](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sect-managing_services_with_systemd-unit_files) 


- For other systems, please refer to the appropriate [documentation](https://blog.frd.mn/how-to-set-up-proper-startstop-services-ubuntu-debian-mac-windows/)

</p>
</details>

#### Or schedule scans with cron
Caution: **do not configure crontab execution and continuous scanning at the same time** .   
<details><summary><b>See contab usage</b></summary>
<p>

- Crontab usage:

```
0 0 * * * wpwatcher --quiet
```

To print only ERRORS and WPScan ALERTS, use `--quiet` or set `quiet=Yes` in your config.  
You'll receive email alerts with cron `MAILTO` feature. Add `>/dev/null` to ignore.  

- Crontab with multiple config files usage:
    - `wpwatcher.conf`: contains all configurations except `wp_wites`
    - `site1.txt`: contains first X urls
    - `site2.txt`: contain the rest  ...  

    In your crontab, configure script to run at your convenience. For exemple, with two lists :
```
# Will run at 00:00 on Monday:
0 0 * * 1 wpwatcher --conf wpwatcher.conf --urls site1.txt --quiet
# Will run at 00:00 on Tuesday:
0 0 * * 2 wpwatcher --conf wpwatcher.conf --urls sites2.txt --quiet
```
Warning, this kind of setup can lead into having two `wpwatcher` executions at the same time. This might result into failure and/or database corruption because of conccurent accesses to reports database file.
</p>
</details>

### Simple configuration with mail report

Simple configuration file without SMTP authentication 

```ini
[wpwatcher]
wpscan_path=wpscan
wp_sites=   [ {"url":"exemple.com"},
              {"url":"exemple2.com"}  ]
wpscan_args=[   "--format", "json",
                "--no-banner",
                "--random-user-agent", 
                "--disable-tls-checks",
                "--api-token", "YOUR_API_TOKEN" ]
send_email_report=Yes
email_to=["me@exemple.com"]
smtp_server=mailserver.exemple.com:25
from_email=WordPressWatcher@exemple.com
```
You can store the API Token in the WPScan default config file at `~/.wpscan/scan.yml` and not supply it via the wpscan CLI argument in the WPWatcher config file. See [WPSacn readme](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#save-api-token-in-a-file).

### Full configuration options

<details><summary><b>See all configuration options with explanatory comments.</b></summary>
<p>

#### WPScan path
Path to wpscan executable. 
With RVM could be `/usr/local/rvm/gems/default/wrappers/wpscan`.  
Path is parsed with shlex.  
If missing, assume `wpscan` is in your `PATH`.  

```ini
wpscan_path=wpscan
```
#### WPScan arguments
Global WPScan arguments.  
Must be a valid Json string.  
<!-- Set `"--format","json"` to use Json parsing feature.  
The list of warnings, alerts and infos might differ when using json  
    Email outpout will be more concice.   
    But not all informations are logged.   
Using `"--format", "cli"` will parse full WPScan output with [!] etc  
    Logs all informations   -->

See `wpscan --help` for more informations about WPScan options  
```ini
wpscan_args=[   "--format", "cli",
                "--no-banner",
                "--random-user-agent", 
                "--disable-tls-checks",
                "--detection-mode", "aggressive",
                "--enumerate", "t,p,tt,cb,dbe,u,m"]
```
Overwrite with `--wpargs "WPScan arguments"`. If you run into option parsing error, start the arguments string with a space or use equals sign `--wpargs="[...]"` to avoid [argparse bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16174992/cant-get-argparse-to-read-quoted-string-with-dashes-in-it?noredirect=1&lq=1).
#### False positive strings
You can use this to ignore some warnmings or alerts.  
False positives will still be processed as infos: Use with care.   
Must be a valid Json string
```ini
false_positive_strings=["You can get a free API token with 50 daily requests by registering at https://wpvulndb.com/users/sign_up"]
```
#### Monitored sites

## Email reports

One report is generated per site and the reports are sent individually when finished scanning a website.

Email notification can have 5 status: 
- `ALERT`: You have a vulnerable Wordpress, theme or plugin
- `WARNING`: You have an oudated Wordpress, theme or plugin
- `FIXED`: All issues are fixed or ignored (warnings included if `send_warnings=Yes`) 
- `INFO`: WPScan did not find any issues with your site
- `ERROR`: WPScan failed

![WPWatcher Report List](/screens/wpwatcher-report-list.png "WPWatcher Report")

Tip: set `"--format","json"` in  `wpscan_args` config option to use the json parsing feature and have more concise email text. 

Alerts, Warnings and Infos might differ whether you're using cli or json format.

![WPWatcher Report](/screens/wpwatcher-report.png "WPWatcher Report")

## Output

Log file and stdout outputs are easily grepable with the following log levels and keywords:
  - `CRITICAL`: Only used for `WPScan ALERT`
  - `ERROR`:  WPScan failed, send report failed or other errors
  - `WARNING`: Only used for `WPScan WARNING`
  - `INFO`: Used for info output , `WPScan INFO` and `FIXED` issues
  - `DEBUG`: Used for debug outup and raw WPScan output. 

In addition to log messages, the readable report, and raw WPScan output can be printed with `--verbose`.

## Library usage

<details><summary><b>See guidelines and exemple</b></summary>
<p>

- Init config dict from file with `WPWatcherConfig().build_config()` method  
- Customize the config if you want, you can overwrite any config values  
- Create a `WPWatcher` object with your desired configuration  
- Call `run_scans_and_notify()` method. Return a `tuple (exit code, reports)` The prorgam will automatically load and use a local reports databse and return complete updated database. Set `wp_reports` to `null` to only return scanned site reports.


```python
from wpwatcher.config import WPWatcherConfig
from wpwatcher.core import WPWatcher
config, files = WPWatcherConfig(files=['./demo.conf']).build_config() # leave None to find default config file
config.update({ 'send_infos':   True,
                'wp_sites':     [   {'url':'exemple1.com'},
                                    {'url':'exemple2.com'}  ],
                'wpscam_args': ['--stealthy'],
                'wp_reports': 'null'
            })
w=WPWatcher(config)
exit_code, reports = w.run_scans_and_notify()
for r in reports:
    print("%s\t\t%s"%( r['site'], r['status'] ))
```

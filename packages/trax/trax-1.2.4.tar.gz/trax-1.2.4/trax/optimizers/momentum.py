class Momentum(base.Optimizer):
  r"""A Nesterov momentum optimizer.

  This class implements a Nesterov momentum variant of stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD). The implementation is based on the concepts in Sutskever et
  al. (2013) [http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/sutskever13.pdf],
  reformulated in Bengio et al. (2012) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0901],
  to work well with backpropagation (equations 6 and 7):

  $$v_t = \mu_{t-1}v_{t-1} - \epsilon_{t-1}\nabla f(\Theta_{t-1})$$

  $$\Theta_t = \Theta_{t-1} - \mu_{t-1} v_{t-1} + \mu_t v_t + v_t$$

  where $$\mu_{t-1}$$ is the momentum (decay) coefficient at time step $$t-1$$
  and $$\epsilon_{t-1}$$ is the learning rate at time step $$t-1$$.

  Note that the implementation below also includes a weight decay rate
  ($$\alpha$$) on the parameters, independent of the Nesterov momentum.

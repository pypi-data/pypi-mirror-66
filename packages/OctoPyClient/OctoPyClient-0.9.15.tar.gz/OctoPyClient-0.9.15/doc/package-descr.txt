An OctoPrint client interface for small TFT touch-screen displays.

OctoPyClient can be installed on any X11 server either with or without a
window-manager. It has been designed to support small displays with at
least 480x320 resolution.  Displays with larger resolutions such as 
800x480 are compatible.

OctoPyClient may be installed (co-located) with an OctoPrint server or may be
used remotely on a Linux Desktop within a window. Any system with the
appropriate Python3 (>=3.6) and GTK+3 support should, in all likelyhood, work
reasonalby well. Raspian Buster (Debian 10) is supported, Raspian Stretch
(Python 3.5) is not.

This application is heavily dependent on GTK/GDK and touch-screen display
interfaces. System requirements for installing and executing OctoPyClient
include proper setup of an X11 server for your choosen display hardware
and the necessary Python GTK and Cairo libraries.

Additional Installation information can be found in README.md in the
source package.

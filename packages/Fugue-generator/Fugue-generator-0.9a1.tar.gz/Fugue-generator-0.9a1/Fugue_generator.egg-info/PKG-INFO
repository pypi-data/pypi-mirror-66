Description: _Fugue_ is a Python-based static site generator that uses XSLT as 
        its template language, somewhat inspired by the [Symphony CMS](https://www.getsymphony.com/). 
        The target use case is website creation from a collection of XML documents 
        (e.g. a book written in [DocBook](https://docbook.org/whatis) or [TEI](https://tei-c.org/), 
        or a collection of EAD or EAC-CPF finding aids).
        
        It was developed at Brown University Library for the 
        [Furnace and Fugue](https://library.brown.edu/create/digitalpublications/current-projects/furnace-and-fugue/) 
        project.

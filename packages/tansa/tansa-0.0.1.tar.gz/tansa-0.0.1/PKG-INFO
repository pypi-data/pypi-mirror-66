Description: # Name for JSON
        A filter to get the json file content from filename in a command line terminal. Type less with a file name along with ```tansa```, while the tansa takes care of frustrating search. 
        
        ## Quick Start
        ### Installation
        The simplest installation method.
        
        	pip install tansa
        
        ### Sample
        While sample.json is in your current/nested directory,
        
        	$ tansa sample
        
        which will display json contents.
        
        	[{'sample.json':{key:value}, 'sample2.json':{key:value}}]
        
        ## Development
        The tansa takes one argument as a file name to look for. Customers are free from entering the exact file name such as suffix because the tansa append ```*``` to the input as its suffix.

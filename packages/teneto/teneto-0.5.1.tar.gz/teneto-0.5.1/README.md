## What is the package

Package includes various tools for analyzing temporal network data. Temporal network measures, temporal network generation, derivation of time-varying/dynamic connectivities, plotting functions.

Some extra focus is placed on neuroimaging data (e.g. compatible with BIDS - _NB: currently not compliant with latest release candidate of BIDS Derivatives_).

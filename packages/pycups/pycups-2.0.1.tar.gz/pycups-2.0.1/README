CUPS bindings for Python
------------------------

These Python bindings are intended to wrap the CUPS API.

Python 3 or later is required since Python 2 is unsupported since 2020-01-01.

Build dependencies
------------------

The following packages are needed for compiling PyCUPS. GCC compiler is needed because modules are written
in C. CUPS development files are needed for providing CUPS API, which are used in modules and Python3
development files for Python3 functions called in modules.

Packages needed for compilation (default package names are from Fedora, Ubuntu names are in the brackets
if they differ from Fedora):

- gcc
- cups-devel (libcups2-dev)
- python3-devel (python3-dev)

Please install them before compiling PyCUPS.

Runtime dependencies
--------------------

CUPS needs to be installed and running for PyCUPS working correctly.

How to compile and install
--------------------------

Do the following steps in the PyCUPS directory:
$ make
$ sudo make install

How to import cups module in python3 script
-------------------------------------------

>>> import cups

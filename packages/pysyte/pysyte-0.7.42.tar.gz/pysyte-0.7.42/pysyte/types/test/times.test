The pysyte.types.times module
=============================

    >>> from pysyte.types import times
    >>> assert 'datetime for pysyte types' in times.__doc__

More imports to support testing
-------------------------------

    >>> import datetime

Time taken
----------

The unix time epoch starts in 1970
    >>> assert times.epoch.year == 1970

Adding an hour
    >>> later = datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, times.epoch.hour + 1, 0)

And can then find out how long was taken between those
    (An hour in 60 (minutes) by 60 (seconds) by a thousand (micro)
    >>> assert times.taken(later - times.epoch) == 60 * 60 * 1_000

Number of seconds since unix started counting is rather large
    At least a billion of them
    >>> assert times.seconds_since_epoch() > 1_000_000_000

Which is at least a trillion microseconds
    >>> assert times.microseconds_since_epoch() > 1_000_000_000_000

The genome tree toolkit is a collection of methods for working with genome trees. It is primarily intended to be used by the GTDB curation team, but has been made available in case others find it useful. It currently supports:

<i>Taxonomy manipulation:</i>
* filling missing ranks
* stripping taxonomy from Newick files
* pulling taxonomy information from a Newick tree

<i>Measures of tree stability:</i>
* bootstrap support
* jackknife taxa support
* jackknife gene support

<i>Tree manipulation:</i>
* outgrouping
* pruning

<i>Tree inference:</i>
* SSU and LSU trees

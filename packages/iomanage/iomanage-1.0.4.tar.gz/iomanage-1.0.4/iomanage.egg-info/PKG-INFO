Description: # IOManage
         Manages IO operations of a single file
        
        ## Applications in which this library is useful
        
        The only scenario I made this library for is when reading and
        writing from a single file in more than a single thread.
        
        ## Features
        
        ```diff
        + Read/Write queue system
        + Can cleanly close file, finishing all r/w functions before terminating
        + ID system for holding queue for write after a read to prevent data mismatching
        + Loop runs in its own thread, so no asyncio management is required
        ```

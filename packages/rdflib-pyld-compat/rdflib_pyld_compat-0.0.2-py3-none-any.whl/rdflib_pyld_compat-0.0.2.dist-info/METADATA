Support (some) data conversion between `rdflib` and `pyld` Python libraries.

The `rdflib
<http://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/>`_
and `PyLD
<https://github.com/digitalbazaar/pyld>`_ libraries use different in-memory data structures so it
is not trivial to use the powerful RDF support of rdflib in conjuction with the JSON-LD processor
implementation of PyLD. This code is designed to provide a bridge between rdflib and PyLD in-memory
formats, avoiding the need to serialize and then re-parse the data.

*N.B.* - This code is currently pinned to `pyparsing < 3.0.0
<https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/2.4.7/>`_ and `PyLD 1.0.5
<https://pypi.org/project/PyLD/1.0.5/>`_ so that it works with Python 2.7. 
If there is any further development this pin should be removed and then
it will work only with Python 3.6 and up.

Limitations
-----------

This code was developed to support a particular application and then pulled out as I needed it a
second time. I haven't thought hard about the general case and am sure that are additional
limitations beyond those I know about. Known limitations:

* assumes the URIRefs in an rdflib graph do not need expansion with a NamespaceManager

Contributing
------------

I'd be happy to hear of other problems/limitations and/or suggestions for improvement.

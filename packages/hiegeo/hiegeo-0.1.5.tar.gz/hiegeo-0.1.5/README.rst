README
===================

This is the README file for the supplementary material provided with
the manuscript "hiegeo: a novel Python module to model stratigraphic
alluvial architectures, constrained by stratigraphic hierarchy and
relative chronology" by C.Zuffetti, A.Comunian, R.Bersezio and
P.Renard.

Hereiafter we report a brief "quick start guide".  For additional
information about how to install and run the provided Python scripts,
please check out the full documentation from `this link
<https://hiegeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ can be also
dowloaded as PDF, EPUB and also as a local HTML archive `here
<https://readthedocs.org/projects/hiegeo/downloads/>`_.



Installation
=========================

1) Clone or download this repository on your hard drive.
2) If required, unpack it and ``cd hiegeo``.
3) Inside the project directory, from the command line::

     pip install -e .

4) To check if it worked, open a Python terminal and try::

     import hiegeo

Examples
==============================

To test the package, move to the folder ``examples`` and there, from
the command line, run one of the two provided demostration scripts.
For example::

  ./hiegeo_test-simple.py

and hit <Enter>.
On Linux you will probably need to give execution rights to the file, like this::

  chmod +x hiegeo_test-simple.py

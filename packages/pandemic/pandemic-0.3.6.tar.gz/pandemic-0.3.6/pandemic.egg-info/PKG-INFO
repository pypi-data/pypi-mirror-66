Description: # Pandemic
        
        An agent model in which commuting, compliance, testing and contagion parameters drive
        infection in a population. Agents follow OU drift processes
        on the plane. Viral load is estimated from geohashing. A population 
        of 5,000,000 or so can be used without computational issue, although the default
        parameters for city generation assume something closer to 40,000.

        ### Usage 
        
        The author is not an epidemiologist. There is nothing sacrosanct about the default parameters. 
        
            pip install pandemic
            >> from pandemic import run
            >> run()
            
         There are a few example of modifying the parameters in pandemic.main
        
        
        ### Basic elements of the model 
        
        Covered in this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pandemic-minimalist-2d-ornstein-uhlenbeck-model-peter-cotton-phd) with 
        the followup [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-new-zealand-heres-how-simulate-covid-19-all-your-cotton-phd/) where possible
        improvements are also discussed and acknowledgements are made.

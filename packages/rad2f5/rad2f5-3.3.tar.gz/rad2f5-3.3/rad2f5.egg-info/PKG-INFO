Description: rad2f5
        ======
        
        This is a simple script to convert Radware Appdirector configurations to F5 configuration. This was written in Python v2.7 but is expected to work on v3.
        
        Install using pip:
        
        ``pip install rad2f5``
        
        Usage
        =====
        ``Usage: rad2f5 <filename> [partition]``
        
        Output is to stdout and shows statistics about the number of objects and then F5-syntax configuration. 
        This F5 configuration can be loaded onto an F5 device using ``tmsh load sys config merge file /var/tmp/<filename> verify``. 
        Fix any issues and load with ``tmsh load sys config merge file /var/tmp/<filename>``
        
        The certificates and keys will be output into the current directory, these should be uploaded to the BIG-IP in the /var/tmp
        directory and run the script check_certs.sh to ensure the certs and keys are correct, then run load_certs to load the certificates and keys.

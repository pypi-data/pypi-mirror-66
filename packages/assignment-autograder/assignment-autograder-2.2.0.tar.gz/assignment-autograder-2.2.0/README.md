# Installation (Linux-only)
1) Run `pip3 install assignment-autograder`
# Usage
1) Create tests directory in the same directory as student submissions. It has to follow the same structure as one of the examples.
2) Create input and output text files in their respective directories for each testcase.
3) Create config.ini in tests. You can use autograder/default_config.ini as a reference. Also, you can find filter function list in the autograder/filters.py. If you don't add some configuration fields, grader will use the default fields from default config.
4) run `autograder path/to/submissions/dir` from command line. If you are in the same directory as submissions, you can simply run `autograder`.
5) You can use --generate_results command line argument to generate a result file per student.
## Writing testcases
* When writing testcases, assume that helper functions NO_RESULT(), RESULT(int r), PASS(), FAIL() are predefined and use them to return student scores to the grader
* Each helper function terminates the execution of the program and returns its respective exit code that signifies student's score for the testcase
* Each testcase is graded out of 100%, which means that you can fully control how much partial credit is given
* ### Helper functions
    * NO_RESULT() indicates that we do not check student's return values for the testcase and that we only care about their output.
    * RESULT(int r) returns student's score r back to the grader
    * PASS() returns the score of 100% back to the grader and is equivalent to RESULT(100)
    * FAIL() returns the score of 0% back to the grader and is equivalent to RESULT(0)
    * Note: when grading java code, we don't use helper functions directly. Instead, we call them from TestHelper class which, you can assume, is predefined for your testcases
# Implementation details
* Currently, there is support for grading C, Java, and Python code
* Exit codes  1 - 2, 126 - 165, and 255 have special meaning and should NOT be used for student scores. In the latest version of this readme, I used 0, 3-103 where 0 means NO_RESULT and 3-103 stand for respective student scores minus 3. The shift by 3 is used to prevent the use of standard exit codes
* If you want to add a new language for grading, you have to create a subclass of TestCase in autograder/testcases.py following the pattern of other subclasses and a respective test helper module in autograder/tests/test_helpers directory, then import the subclass into autograder/grader.py, and add it to ALLOWED_LANGUAGES dictionary
* At the point of writing this readme, output checking is a PASS or FAIL process (i.e. no partial credit possible). The reason is that allowing for 'partial similarity' of outputs is too error-prone and could yield too many points for students that did not actually complete the task properly. If you want to increase the chances of students' output matching, you should use FILTER_FUNCTION(s) defined in autograder/grader.py instead
* If you don't prototype student functions in your C testcases, you will run into undefined behavior. 
* Multiprocessing was a feature in the past but it has so many drawbacks that it was deemed unnecessary for the task

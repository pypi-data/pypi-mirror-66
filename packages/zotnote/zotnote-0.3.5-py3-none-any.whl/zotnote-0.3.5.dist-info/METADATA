You can find a roadmap for ZotNote [here](https://github.com/Bubblbu/zotnote/issues/7).

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or higher
- [Zotero Standalone](https://www.zotero.org/) with [Better Bibtex plugin](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)

### Recommended: Install via pipx

The recommended way to install ZotNote is using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/). Pipx cleanly install the package in an isolated environment (clean uninstalls!) and automagically exposes the CLI-endpoints globally on your system.

    pipx install zotnote

### Option 2: Install via pip

However, you can also simply use pip. Please be aware of the Python version and environments you are using.

    pip install zotnote

### Option 3: Download from GitHub

Download the latest release from Github and unzip. Put the folder containing the scripts into your `PATH`.

Alternatively, run


    [sudo] python3 setup.py install

or

    python3 setup.py install --user

### Option 4: Git clone (for developers)

    git clone git@github.com:Bubblbu/zotnote.git

The project is being developed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager.

More instructions will follow soon!

'''Example 01

Shows how to create simple geometry from splines and ellipse arcs, and how to mesh a quad mesh in GmshMesher.
Also demonstrates drawGeometry(), drawMesh, and drawing texts and labels in a figure.

# Add points:
#  The first parameter is the coordinates. These can be in 2D or 3D.
#  The other parameters are not defined in this example. These parameters are
#  ID, marker, and elSize.
#  Since we do not specify an ID the points are automatically assigned IDs,

# Add curves:
#  There are four types of curves. In this example we create an ellipse arc
#  and some splines. The first parameter is a list of point IDs that define
#  the curve. Curves can have have IDs and markers. In this example the IDs
#  are undefined so the curves are automatically assigned IDs. The markers can
#  be used for identifying regions/boundaries in the model.


# 0 - An ellipse arc. Read the function
#     doc for more information. The four
#     points are
#     [start, center, majorAxis, end]

g.spline([0, 1], marker=80)           # 1 - A spline. Splines pass through the
                                      #     points in the first parameter.

                                      #     The start and end points are the same

# Add a surface:
#  Surfaces are defined by its curve boundaries.
#  The first parameter is a list of curve IDs that specify the outer boundary
#  of the surface. The second parameter is a list of lists of curve IDs that
#  specify holes in the surface. In this example there are two holes. The
#  boundaries and holes must be closed paths. We can see that [7] is closed
#  because curve 7 is a closed spline. addSurface creates a flat surface, so
#  all curves must lie on the same plane.

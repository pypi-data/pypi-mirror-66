Welcome to the Mistral documentation!
=====================================

Mistral is the OpenStack workflow service. This project aims to provide
a mechanism to define tasks and workflows without writing code, manage
and execute them in the cloud environment.

A workflow visualization tool is available via
`CloudFlow <https://github.com/nokia/CloudFlow>`_ and will help you debug
workflow executions, identify execution paths, explore task run times,
easily access input/output values and so many more...

        # HTSeq

        A Python library to facilitate processing and analysis of data
        from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. A popular use of ``HTSeq``
        is ``htseq-count``, a tool to quantify gene expression in RNA-Seq and similar
        experiments.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        To use ``HTSeq`` you will need:
        
        -  ``Python 2.7`` or ``Python >= 3.5`` 
        -  ``numpy``
        -  ``pysam >= 0.9.0``
        
        To run the ``htseq-qa`` script, you will also need:
        
        -  ``matplotlib >=1.4``
        
        Both **Linux** and **OSX** are supported and binaries are provided on Pypi.
        
        A source package which should not require ``Cython`` nor ``SWIG`` is also
        provided on Pypi.
        
        To **develop** `HTSeq` you will **also** need:
        
        -  ``Cython >=0.29.5``
        -  ``SWIG >=3.0.8``
        
        **Windows is not officially supported** as we don't have access to a Continuous
        Integration Windows machine that supports ``pysam``. Please do **not** open an
        issue asking to support Windows installers: we do not know how to do that and 
        do not have the bandwidth to learn. However, if you are interested in giving it
        a try yourself, we are happy to provide as much support as we can.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### PIP
        
        To install directly from PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        pip install HTSeq
        ```
        
        To install a specific version:
        
        ```bash
        pip install 'HTSeq==0.14.0'
        ```
        
        If this fails, please install all dependencies first:
        
        ```bash
        pip install 'matplotlib>=1.4'
        pip install Cython
        pip install 'pysam>=0.9'
        pip install HTSeq
        ```
        
        ### setup.py (distutils/setuptools)
        
        Install the dependencies with your favourite tool (``pip``, ``conda``,
        etc.).
        
        To install ``HTSeq`` itself, run:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py build install
        ```

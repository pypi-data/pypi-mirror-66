If they are defined, those variables will\nbe used. Parameters passed to the ``HowFastFlaskMiddleware`` constructor take precedence over environment\nvariables.\n\nOnly one variable is available for now:\n\n* ``HOWFAST_APM_DSN``: The DSN (application identifier) that you can find on your APM dashboard. Can also be passed to the constructor as ``app_id``.\n\nIf the environment variable is defined you can then use:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # Install the middleware\n    HowFastFlaskMiddleware(app)\n\nYou can also choose to exclude some URLs from reporting:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # Do not report performance data for some URLs\n    HowFastFlaskMiddleware(\n        app,\n        endpoints_blacklist=[\n            '/some/internal/url/',\n            # You can also use patterns accepted by Python's `fnmatch.fnmatch`, shell-like:\n            '/admin/*',\n            '/jobs/*/results',\n            '/endpoint/?',  # will blacklist /endpoint and /endpoint/\n        ],\n    )\n",

Description: A simple, dependency-free, blacklist-based filename sanitizer, for when you want to keep the original filename.
        
        Note that a blacklist based sanitizer will _never_ be as safe as a whitelist based one. In most cases, your best option is to create a safe filename yourself. Your second safest option is to use a whitelist approach (allowing only certain characters). This sanitizer is useful when you want to keep the original filename, including non ascii characters, whenever possible.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip install sanitize_filename
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python3
        from sanitize_filename import sanitize
        
        
        filename = input("Enter a file name:")
        filename = sanitize(filename)
        ```
        
        Examples:
        
        ```python3
        > sanitize("A/B/C.txt")
        'ABC.txt'
        
        > sanitize("this𓀦filenameḜisあactually...valid.txt")
        'this𓀦filenameḜisあactually...valid.txt'
        
        > sanitize("def.")
        'def'
        
        > sanitize("NUL")
        '__NUL'
        
        > sanitize("..")
        '__'
        ```

Description: quickly
        =======
        
        The quickly python package will become the successor of python-ly.
        
        It is currently in the planning phase.
        
        Like python-ly, it will provide tools to manipulate LilyPond music documents,
        but instead of using the lexer in python-ly, which is very difficult to
        maintain, it will use the new parce package at https://parce.info for parsing
        LilyPond files.

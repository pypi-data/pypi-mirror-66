    any test management system, the 'basic unit' of a single test for
    which some results are expected to be reported. In 'Wikitcms', for
    instance, this corresponds to a single row in a results table, and
    that is what the ResultRow() subclass represents. A subclass for
    QATracker would represent a single test in a build of a product.

    The 'testcase' is the basic identifier of a test instance. It will
    not necessarily be unique, though - in any test management system
    you may find multiple test instances for the same test case (in
    different builds and different products). The concept of the
    name derives from Wikitcms, where it is not uncommon for a set of
    test instances to have the same 'testcase' but a different 'name',
    which in that system is the link text: there will a column which
    for each row contains [[testcase|name]], the testcase being the
    same but the name being different. The concept doesn't seem
    entirely specific to Wiki TCMS, though, so it's represented here.
    Commonly the 'testcase' and 'name' will be the same, when each
    instance within a set has a different 'testcase' the name should
    be identical to the testcase.

    milestone is, roughly, the priority of the test: milestone is
    slightly Fedora-specific language, a hangover from early wikitcms
    versions which didn't consider other systems. For Fedora it will
    be Alpha, Beta or Final, usually. For Ubuntu it may be
    'mandatory', 'optional' or possibly 'disabled'.

    results is required to be a dict of lists; the dict keys represent
    the test's environments. If the test system does not have the
    concept of environments, the dict can have a single key with some
    sort of generic name (like 'Results'). The values must be lists of
    instances of wikitcms.Result or a subclass of it.

    of columns in the table in which the result was found (this is
    needed to figure out the environments for the results, as the envs
    are represented by table columns, and to know which cell to edit
    when modifying results). origtext is the text which was parsed to
    produce the instance, if it was produced by the from_wiki_row()
    class method which parses wiki text to produce instances. section
    and secid are the wiki page section in which the table from which
    the row came is located; though these are in a way attributes of
    the page, this is really another case where an MW attribute is
    just a way of encoding information about a *test*. The splitting
    of result pages into sections is a way of sub-grouping tests in
    each page. So it's appropriate to store those attributes here.

    At present you typically get ResultRow instances by calling a
    ComposePage's get_resultrows() method, which runs its text through
    result.find_resultrows(), which isolates the result rows in the
    wiki text and runs through through this class' from_wiki_row()

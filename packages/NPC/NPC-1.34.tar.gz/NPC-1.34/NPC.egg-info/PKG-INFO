Description: 
        
        # Introduction
        
        NTP is a new parallel threading model which work in **network level**. Here two types of process work.
        
        1. Communication
        2. Execution
        
        Here communication start using local parallel thread but the execution happens in network devices.
        
        NPC is Network Processor Client to interface with Network Processor.
        Network can be run using Virtual Machine [Tested in Oracle Virtual Box]. Download the Netowork Processor from https://ntp.perity.site/NTP.ova
        
        # Usage
        
            import NPC
        
            NPC.register(ip, file_path) # ip = Machine IP Address, file_path = path to token.txt
        
            NPC.findServers() # Find for execution servers
        
            NPC.ntpExec(program,ip,timeout) # program = Code Written in Python, ip = Machine IP Address, timeout = Integer value in seconds
        
            NPC.fileTransfer(ip, file_path) # ip = Machine IP Address, file_path = path to your file

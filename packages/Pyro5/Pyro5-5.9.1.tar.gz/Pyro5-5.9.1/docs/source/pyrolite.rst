*******************************************
Pyrolite - client library for Java and .NET
*******************************************

This library allows your Java or .NET program to interface very easily with
the Python world. It uses the Pyro protocol to call methods on remote
objects.

@TODO update this library to understand Pyro5's wire protocol; it currently only works for Pyro4.

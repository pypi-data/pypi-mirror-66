Description: # The `pidgy` package and paper
        
        `pidgy` is a fun way to program in [Markdown] in your favorite IDE (jupyter, nteract, colab, vscode) and use them in python modules, scripts, and applications.

        ```bash
        pip install pidgy    # Install pidgy
        ```
        
        `pidgy` provides an interactive literate programming experience that allows fluid combinations of code and prose. It has some added language features like block markdown variables, emoji variables names, and interactive formal testing. It is designed primarily for Jupyter notebooks and Markdown source files.
        
        ## The pidgy shell and kernel
        
        `pidgy` can be used as a native `jupyter` kernel in Jupyter, nteract, colab, and vscode. Install the kernel with
        
        ```bash
        pidgy kernel install # install the pidgy kernel.
        ```
        
        Or, in your standard Python shell, load the `pidgy` `IPython` extension.
        
        ## Importing `pidgy` documents
        
        `pidgy` uses the `importnb` machinery to import files into [Python] that are not native `".py"` files.
        
            import pidgy
            with pidgy.pidgyLoader(): ...
        
        ## The `pidgy` CLI
        
        The `pidgy` cli helps to tangle and weave entire literate pidgy programs.

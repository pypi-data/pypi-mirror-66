Description: # ImageNet Voice
        This dataset is derived from ImageNet, and contains synthetic recordings of TTS voices saying each ImageNet label 200 times. This is more or less a toy dataset, but can be very useful for projects with little-to-no data.
        
        ### Usage
        After installing with `python3 -m pip install imagenet-voice`, ImageNet-Voice can be imported and used like most other datasets:
        ```python
        import imagenet_voice
        
        X, y = imagenet_voice.load(progress=True, download_data=True)
        ```
        The [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/imagenet-voice/) includes 3 loading functions:
        - `load(progress, download_data)` - Load the entire dataset. If `progress`, display a progressbar. If `download_data`, git clone the dataset.
        - `load_classes(classes, progress, download_data)` - Loads only the classes in the provided `classes` list.
        - `load_n(n, random, progress, download_data)` - Loads `n` classes, alphebtically unless `random=True`.
        
        ### Content
        
        This dataset is currently at 28% capacity, and more will be uploaded soon. Each folder, representing a category in ImageNet, contains 200 unique TTS files generated using [ttsddg](https://pypi.org/project/ttsdg/) using the 7 pre-installed voices in OSX. 
        
        
        ### Acknowledgements
        
        [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) was integral to creating ttsdg. As much trouble as I had with ffmpeg and other audio libraries, pyttsx3 made it much easier than any other option I could've taken to generate this dataset.
        
        I appreciate any help that anyone would be willing to offer to get this dataset at 100% capacity any sooner. Please contact me!
        
        ### Inspiration
        
        I created this dataset to provide training data for a GAN that would take in an audio file of a spoken word and would generate an image of whatever was spoken. I still plan to work on that project, but I'd like to see other people perform similar tasks.

This is a python sdk to manipulate the deezer's API

# Installation

```bash
pip install deezersdk
```

# Import

```bash
import deezersdk
```

# Authentication to the API
- You need to have a Deezer account to use the API.

- You have to go on https://developers.deezer.com/myapps and create an a new app 

- You will need, your Application ID, Secret Key and the Redirect URL.

- First we use the `get_oauth_login_url` method to get a login url
    ```bash
    url = Deezer.get_oauth_login_url(
        app_id=DEEZER_APP_ID, 
        redirect_uri=DEEZER_REDIRECT_URI
    )
    ```
- We have to go the url (if the pop up will open and we will be able to login to your deezer account.)

- You will then be redirected to your redirect url with an authorization code in your url.

- With this code you can, request your access token 
    ```
    Deezer.get_oauth_token(app_id=DEEZER_APP_ID, app_secret=DEEZER_APP_SECRET, code=code)
    ```

- You now have your access token, and can use the SDK.

# Using the sdk
## Instantiate the Deezer object
```bash
dz = Deezer(app_id=DEEZER_APP_ID,
                          app_secret=DEEZER_APP_SECRET,
                          code=YOUR_URL_CODE,
                          token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN)
```

KryPy is a Python 3 module for Krylov subspace methods for the solution of linear algebraic systems. This includes enhanced versions of CG, MINRES and GMRES as well as methods for the efficient solution of sequences of linear systems.

# Features

KryPy gives you an easy-to-use yet flexible interface to Krylov subspace methods for linear algebraic systems. Compared to the implementations in [SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html) (or MATLAB), KryPy allows you to supply additional arguments that may help you to tune the solver for the specific problem you want to solve. The additional arguments may also be of interest if you are doing research on Krylov subspace methods. 

Some features of KryPy are:

*  **User-defined inner products** - useful when solving a linear algebraic system whose operator is self-adjoined in a non-Euclidean inner-product. This way, CG or MINRES can be applied to self-adjoined (but non-symmetric/non-Hermitian) operators easily.
*  **Full control of preconditioners** - the order of applying preconditioners matters. This is why you can supply two left preconditioners (one of whom implicitly changes the inner product and thus has to be positive definite) and one right preconditioner. Take a look at the arguments ```M```, ```Ml``` and ```Mr```.
*  **Get the Arnoldi/Lanczos basis and Hessenberg matrix** - you want to extract further information from the generated vectors (e.g. recycling)? Just pass the optional argument ```store_arnoldi=True```.
*  **Explicitly computed residuals on demand** - if you do research on Krylov subspace methods or preconditioners, then you sometimes want to know the explicitly computed residual in each iteration (in contrast to an updated residual which can be obtained implicitly). Then you should pass the optional argument ```explicit_residual=True```.
*  **Compute errors** - if you have (for research purposes) the exact solution at hand and want to monitor the error in each iteration instead of the residual, you can supply the optional argument ```exact_solution=x_exact``` to the ```LinearSystem```.

# Usage

### Documentation
The documentation is hosted at
[krypy.readthedocs.org](http://krypy.readthedocs.org).

### Example
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nschloe/krypy/master/example.png)

The above convergence history is obtained with the following example where the
[Gmres](http://krypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/krypy.linsys.html#krypy.linsys.Gmres)
method is used to solve the linear system `A*x=b` with the diagonal matrix
`A=diag(1e-3,2,...,100)` and right hand side `b=[1,...,1]`.
```python
import numpy
import krypy

A = numpy.diag([1.0e-3] + list(range(2, 101)))
b = numpy.ones(100)

# sol, out = krypy.cg(A, b)
# sol, out = krypy.minres(A, b)
sol, out = krypy.gmres(A, b)

# sol is None if no solution has been found
# out.resnorms the relative residual norms and some more data

# plot residuals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.semilogy(out.resnorms)
plt.show()
```
Of course, this is just a toy example where you would not use GMRES in
practice. KryPy can handle arbitrary large matrices - as long as the (hopefully
sparse) matrices and the generated basis of the Krylov subspace fit into your
memory. ;)
Furthermore, in actual applications, you definitely want to adjust
[Gmres](http://krypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/krypy.linsys.html#krypy.linsys.Gmres)'
parameters such as the residual tolerance.

### Help

Help can be optained via Python's builtin help system. For example, you can use
the `?` in `ipython`:
```python
from krypy.linsys import Gmres
?Gmres
```

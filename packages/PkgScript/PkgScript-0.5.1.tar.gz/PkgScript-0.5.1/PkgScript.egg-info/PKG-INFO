Description: # PkgScript (version 0.5)
        
        Python module that allows a packaged module to run properly as a script. 
        
        It imports the enclosing package(s) into the script, allowing the script to 
        import other modules from the same package family (using explicit relative or 
        absolute import statements).
        
        **!!!  
        `import_parent_packages()` must be called before any package-sibling imports  
        !!!**
        
        ## Examples:
        
        ### Milo.mod_script.py
        ```python
        import pkgscript
        # Only call function if module is being run as a script
        if (__name__ == "__main__") and (__package__ is None):
            pkgscript.import_parent_packages("Milo", globals())
        from Milo.version import __version__
        from .version import __version__    # same as previous line
        ```
        
        ### top_pkg.sub_pkg.sub_sub_pkg.mod_script.py
        ```python
        import pkgscript
        # Only call function if module is being run as a script
        if (__name__ == "__main__") and (__package__ is None):
            pkgscript.import_parent_packages(
                "top_pkg.sub_pkg.sub_sub_pkg", globals())
        # Import top_pkg.sub_pkg.other_module
        from top_pkg.sub_pkg import other_module
        from .. import other_module    # same as previous line
        from ...sub_pkg import other_module    # same as previous line
        ```
        
        ### ALS.Milo.mod_script.py
        ```python
        import pkgscript
        # Only call function if module is being run as a script
        if (__name__ == "__main__") and (__package__ is None):
            pkgscript.import_parent_packages("als.milo", globals())
        from als.milo import __version__, __date__
        from . import __version__, __date__    # same as previous line
        ```

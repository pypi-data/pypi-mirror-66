Publish A Template Project
##########################

Once the project owner added a template release or a linked
template release to her / his project and released it she / he could return
back to the template project page and submit the project for publication.

The project owner could do this within the menubar on the left side. She / he
had to click on the menu entry 'Private' and than click on the entry 'Submit
for publication' in the opening drop down menu. The menu entry will change
from 'Private' to 'Pending'.

The project owner will get an email with an information about this workflow
change. A corresponding email will be send to the administrator or a
configured email address for this task (configured inside
the 'Template Center'.

The project has been forwarded into the review queue of the 'Template
Center' / Plone site.
Once the administrator, site-admiministrator or a reviewer changed the
workflow state again, e.g. published the project, the project owner will get
a further email with this new state.

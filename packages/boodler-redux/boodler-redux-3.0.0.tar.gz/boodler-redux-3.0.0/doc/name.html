<h1>Boodler: About the Name</h1>

<p>
Boodler was inspired by many things. (Not least a very long drive
from Durham to Pittsburgh. And back. Three times in two weeks.)
But one great inspiration was <code>Looching</code>, a strange
soundscape generator implemented many years ago for the NeXT.
</p>

<p>
<code>Looching</code> was named after Looch, the author's dog.
</p>

<p>
I don't have a dog. However, my friends 
<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/index.html">Ginohn</a>
have a dog. They live halfway between Durham and Pittsburgh.
The dog's name is 
<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/pix/Booda.html">Booda</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's good enough for me.

<h2>Other Boodler</h2>

<p>
Bruce Sterling, in 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Hacker_Crackdown/Hacker_Crackdown_HTML/crack_6.html">The Hacker Crackdown</a>,
mentions that "boodler" was 19th-century street slang for "counterfeiter".
</p>

<p>
"Boodle" is a card game (also called "Michigan"), so people who play it
are probably boodlers.
</p>

<p>
"Boodlers" is a musical group featuring Elliott Sharp.

<h1>Boodler: Licensing</h1>

<p>
The licensing situation regarding Boodler is somewhat ornate, because
there are many components involved. (The script <code>boodler</code>,
the Boodler sound engine, the sound files and pieces of code that make
up a given soundscape. Not to mention the fact that soundscapes can
include other soundscapes.) 
</p>

<p>
I have tried to keep the hassle to a minimum. If you are running Boodler
for your own private, non-commercial use, you shouldn't have to worry about
any of this. However, if you intend to use Boodler in a public or broadcast
setting, or in a commercial, for-profit way, or if you intend to incorporate
Boodler in some other project or program, you should read the following.

<h2><a name="using">LICENSING FOR USERS</a></h2>
<h4><em>(Running Boodler)</em></h4>

<p>
Boodler is free software, and you may run it freely. (Portions of the
Boodler source code are copyrighted and licensed under the LGPL or the
GPL, and other portions are public domain. Neither of these restrict
you in any way from running the program.)
</p>

<p>
However, there is another legal issue. Boodler operates by executing
soundscape code, which combines sound-sample files into a ongoing
stream of sound. Legally speaking, when you run Boodler, you are
creating a derivative work based on those code fragments and sound
files.
</p>

<p>
The soundscapes and sound files in the Boodler package library
are <em>not</em> all in the public domain. Many are licensed "for
non-commercial use only". Some of the sound files were found by random
searching around the web, and appear without any copyright statement
at all.
</p>

<p>
It is my opinion (<em>not</em> backed by any legal advice) that if you
run Boodler for your own private use, using packages downloaded from
the Boodler library, then you are within the scope of fair use and the
"non-commercial use" licenses of those sounds.
</p>

<p>
However, if you play the sound output of Boodler (based on the Boodler
package library) as a commercial performance, or include it in a
recording sold for profit, you may not be complying with the copyright
restrictions on those sounds. You will have to look at the license
terms of the packages you use, and decide whether your performance is
legal.
</p>

<p>
Note that this legal issue is a problem of playing sounds and
soundscapes from the Boodler package library. It is not a restriction
of the Boodler software itself. If you create your own Boodler
soundscape, based solely on <em>your own</em> sound-sample files and
code, then that stream of sound is entirely your own work; you may do
with it as you wish.
</p>

<h2><a name="extending">LICENSING FOR SOUNDSCAPE DESIGNERS</a></h2>
<h4><em>(Creating new soundscapes)</em></h4>

<p>
The sound and soundscape packages in the <code>org.boodler</code>
section of the package library (excluding 
<code>org.boodler.old</code>) are in the public domain.
They are intended to be used as code samples as well as soundscapes.
You may modify, extend, combine, and pervert them as you wish.
</p>

<p>
The sound packages in the <code>org.boodler.old</code> section of the
package library are copyrighted, but free for non-commercial use.
They are not free for commercial use.
</p>

<p>
Sound packages elsewhere in the library (not under 
<code>org.boodler</code>) are free for non-commercial use. They may
or may not be free for commercial use, modification, and other
forms of derivative work. See the terms of each package for details.
</p>

<p>
If you create sound files or soundscape code for use with Boodler, you
may license them as you wish -- GPL, LGPL, Creative Commons, some
other license. Or you might choose to not release them at all; you are
not obligated to do so.
</p>

<h2><a name="contributing">LICENSING FOR SOUNDSCAPE CONTRIBUTORS</a></h2>
<h4><em>(Putting your work in the Boodler library)</em></h4>

<p>
You are welcome to contribute your sounds and soundscapes to the
Boodler project. Any properly-formatted package file will be accepted
into the Boodler package library, as long as it is free for users to
enjoy.
</p>

<p>
You are also welcome to repackage and contribute other people's sounds,
as long as their licenses permit you to do so.
</p>

<p>
To be accepted, a package must be, at minimum, free for non-commercial
use. The Boodler project strongly encourages contributions to be either
placed in the public domain, or licensed under an open-source or
Creative Commons license.
</p>

<h2><a name="deriving">LICENSING FOR PROGRAMMERS</a></h2>
<h4><em>(Modifying Boodler and incorporating it into other software)</em></h4>

<p>
I consider Boodler to be more like a software component than a
stand-alone program. Accordingly, I have released it under the 
<a href="LGPL">GNU Library General Public License</a>
(the LGPL). To be precise, the workhorse parts of Boodler -- the
<code>boodle</code> and <code>boopak</code> Python packages -- form a
library, which is licensed under the LGPL.
</p>

<p>
The Python program <code>boodler</code> is simply a shell that starts
up the Boodler library. I have released this program into the public
domain. You may do with it as you like. However, understand that if
you write a program that is intended to link in the Boodler library
(regardless of whether you use the <code>boodler</code> script), then
your program is a work that uses the library, and must behave
appropriately. See the LGPL document for details.
</p>

<p>
One detail: the C source code of the <code>cboodle</code> extensions is 
dual-licensed. You may use it under the terms of the 
<a href="LGPL">LGPL</a>
or the
<a href="GPL">GPL</a>,
whichever you like.
</p>

<h2><a name="warranty">WARRANTY</a></h2>
<h4><em>(The lack of warranty)</em></h4>

<p>
There is no warranty. See the <a href="LGPL">LGPL</a>.

<h1>Boodler: Installation</h1>

<p>
Boodler uses the standard Python distutils system for building and
installation.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
First, download and unpack the source code from the
<a href="http://boodler.org/">Boodler web site</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Boodler is written in Python; you must have a Python interpreter installed
on your system in order to run it. Python 3 is required.
</p>

<p>
Boodler can generate audio output in one form, which is defined by a driver module:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>stdout</code> -- write raw sample output to stdout</li>
</ul>

<h2>The contents of the archive</h2>

<p>
If you list the source directory, you will see the following arrangement:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>./setup.py</dt>
<dd>A script which compiles and installs Boodler on your machine.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodler-ref.html">boodler</a></dt>
<dd>The Boodler program itself. This Python script starts up the Boodler
engine.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodle-mgr-ref.html">boodle-mgr</a></dt>
<dd>A script for installing and managing Boodler soundscape components.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodle-event-ref.html">boodle-event</a></dt>
<dd>A simple script for sending network events to Boodler.</dd>
<dt>./src/...</dt>
<dd>The source code for Boodler. This includes Python code, and also
some native C code which is needed to resample sound data efficiently.</dd>
<dt>./doc/*.html</dt>
<dd>This documentation.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Building Boodler</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Type <em>python setup.py build</em>.
</p>

<p>
This tries to figure out the configuration of your system, and compiles
the Boodler modules which can be compiled.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Type <em>sudo python setup.py install</em>.
</p>

<p>
This installs Boodler in the system's Python directory. The 
<code>sudo</code> command will ask you for your password, which the 
setup script needs to write to a system directory. If you want to
install to a different directory, you could instead type:
</p>

<p>
<em>python setup.py install --prefix <code>directory</code></em>
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Testing Boodler out</h2>

<p>
Try this command:
</p>

<pre>
boodler --testsound
</pre>

<p>
You should hear a quick melody of test tones -- first alternating
between left and right channels, and then playing in both.
</p>

<p>
You can now begin <a href="use.html">using Boodler</a>.
</p>

<h2>If it doesn't work</h2>

<ul>

<li>
You're trying to build Boodler, and you see the error "Python.h: No such 
file or directory".

<ul>
<li>Probably you don't have the Python development package installed on
your machine. This is the set of include files needed to compile C
modules for Python.</li>
<li>If your OS uses RPM packages (Red Hat format),
find the "python-devel" RPM package; if you use some other installation
system, the name will be something similar. Make sure you get the headers
that match your version of Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
You install successfully, but you get the error
"boodler: Command not found."

<ul>
<li>
You probably don't have the Python script directory in your 
<code>PATH</code>. Try <code>/usr/local/bin/boodler</code>, or
(on the Mac)
<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/boodler</code>.</li>
<li>
If you think you added one of those directories to your <code>PATH</code>,
type <code>rehash</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Most soundscapes skip or sound choppy.

<ul>
<li>Your computer is unable to keep up with Boodler's computation.
(This is unlikely on a modern desktop machine, but it could happen
on an older or low-power device.)</li>
<li>Run fewer applications at the same time as Boodler.</li>
<li>If you are using MacOSX, increase the number of sound buffers,
using the <code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code> option.
The default is 6; increasing it to 12 or 16 should help:
<pre>
boodler --define buffercount=12 --testsound
</pre>
</li>
<li>Get a beefier computer.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
You hear clipping noise (mild static) in some soundscapes.

<ul>
<li>You need to reduce the amplitude of Boodler's sound stream as it
passes through your drivers. There are two ways of doing this:</li>
<li>Use a mixer application (such as <code>xmixer</code>,
<code>amixer</code>, or <code>alsamixer</code>) to reduce the 
"PCM" component of your sound driver. You can compensate
by turning up the "Master" component, or just turning up your speakers.</li>
<li>Or, use the <code>--master</code> argument to Boodler, giving it a
master mixing volume <em>less</em> than the default of 0.5. 
Again, you can compensate with a mixer application or by turning up
your speakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

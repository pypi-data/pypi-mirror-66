<h1>Boodler: Version History</h1>

<dl>
<dt>3.0.0 (Apr 25, 2020)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Adds Python 3 compatibility and removes Python 2 compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Removes all output drivers except stdout; audio can now be played with
something like <code>sox</code> using e.g.:

<pre>
boodler com.eblong.ow.storm/OneStorm |\
  play \
    --type=raw \
    --channels=2 \
    --rate=44.1k \
    --encoding=signed-integer \
    --bits=16 \
    -
</pre>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>2.0.4 (Mar 6, 2011)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Removed the ".py" suffixes from the boodler, boodle-mgr, and boodle-event
scripts.
</p>
<p>
Used the modern set class, where available, to avoid a deprecation warning
on Python 2.6.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.3 (Nov 18, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixed, or worked around, a bug that prevented --testsound from working
on Python 2.6.
</p>
<p>
Adjusted the package creation tool to skip .pyc files, and anything that
looks like compiled code. It will now also skip redundant package
requirements, and warn about any package which is required in two different
ways.
</p>
<p>
Added a JACKB driver: the JACK audio system, using the Bio2Jack library.
(I'm not convinced that Bio2Jack is the right way to go, which is why
I didn't call this one "JACK". It produces deprecation warnings when
building with the latest JACK library.)
</p>
<p>
Adjusted the <code>listen</code> module to work on Windows, unless the
--stdinevents option is used. (That option requires <code>fcntl</code>,
which is not available on Windows.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.2 (Jan 28, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixed the --default-driver option in setup.py, which broke at some point.
</p>
<p>
ALSA: fixed bug where the last moment of a soundscape would be cut short.
</p>
<p>
MACOSX: fixed bug where the first moment of a soundscape could skip a little.
</p>
<p>
Added a OSXAQ driver (based on code contributed by Aaron Griffith).
This is recommended on MacOSX 10.5 and later. Also compatible with the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
Added a PULSE driver, for the PulseAudio sound system used in (Linux)
Ubuntu 8.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.1 (Jan 14, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixed trivial bugs that prevented Boodler from working on Python 2.3.5.
(The "generate_pydoc" setup.py command still will not work, but you
don't need to run that; the pydocs are all generated already.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.0 (Jan 12, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Complete redesign of the module system. Soundscapes are now downloaded
and installed as packages (.boop files) from the Boodler web site.
Packages can import other packages, with full versioning capability.
</p>
<p>
The Boodler sound library is divided up into packages. Agents deal with
sounds as Python objects, not pathname strings.
</p>
<p>
You no longer need to mess around with environment variables to run
Boodler.
</p>
<p>
Agents now provide metadata describing themselves and their command-line
arguments. Arguments are parsed into appropriate types and classes
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Many other new features, including channel properties, better channel
events, saner stereo pan logic.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.6.1 (Sep 28, 2007)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added LAME MP3 driver.
</p>
<p>
Changed the license of the cboodle module (but not the rest of Boodler) 
to be usable as either GPL or LGPL. (Satisfies the conditions of LAME,
which is a GPL library.)
</p>
<p>
Fixed setup script to compile OSS correctly on BSD.
</p>
<p>
Updated the ALSA driver to work with the modern Linux API.
(Thanks to Jason McBrayer for testing.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.6.0 (Sep 16, 2007)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Lots of changes...
</p>
<p>
Changed the configure/build system to use a standard Python distutils
script.
</p>
<p>
You can now build Boodler with multiple output drivers, and choose
among them at runtime.
</p>
<p>
Added Shoutcast and Ogg Vorbis drivers (contributed by Aaron Griffith).
Also a stdout driver.
</p>
<p>
MacOSX driver now allows you to choose a particular sound device, if you
have more than one.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.3 (May 2, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Improved skip-resistance in MacOSX version, by using a multiple sound
buffers. Added <code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code> option,
to control this.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.2 (Apr 30, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added MacOSX support. Tested with Python installed as an OSX framework;
might also work with "Unix-style" Python configuration.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.0 (Feb 19, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the <code>stereo</code> module, and the ability to create a channel
at a particular stereo position. (No, you still can't <em>change</em> a
channel's stereo position as it plays. That's harder. Sorry.)
</p>
<p>
Added many sounds to the library, and many soundscapes to the effects
directory.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.4.0 (Dec 17, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the pwrain and owstorm modules, contributed by Peter and Owen Williams.
</p>
<p>
Added support for Unix domain sockets, as an alternative to network
sockets.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.3.0 (Dec 12, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the <code>--integer</code> argument to <code>configure.py</code>.
This uses integer computation in some places instead of floating-point
computation. Possibly useful on very old machines, or very tiny ones
(such as PDAs).
</p>
<p>
Removed some obsolete code from the OSS driver, which was failing on
the Zaurus.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.2.0 (Dec 3, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added a command-line argument which is passed down to the sound interface
unchanged. This allows interface-specific arguments.
</p>
<p>
Added the FILE interface, which writes raw sound output to a disk file
instead of to the computer's sound hardware.
</p>
<p>
Added some agents to the listen module, which respond to standard 
remote-control button events. (See the serialwatch.py script on the
"Accessories" page of the
<a href="http://boodler.org/boodler-1/">Boodler project 
web site</a>.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.1.0 (Nov 27, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added configuration script.
Added support for ALSA and ESD sound interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Fixed bug in OSS interface which caused clicking on machines with only
two kernel sound buffers.
</p>
<p>
Rearranged the event-listening system. Agents must now be of a particular
subclass (EventAgent) in order to be posted to listen for events. The
event triggers an agent.receive(event) method, instead of agent.run().
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Initial release (Nov 22, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Initial release. Only supports OSS sound driver.
</p>
</dd>

# 0.2
* Major rewrite to accommodate for other types of connections than ODBC in the future.
    * Breaking change: It is now necessary to specify imstype when initiating a client.
* Updated to new DAS server address. 
* Forced keep_tz=False to suppress FutureWarning in Pandas >= 0.24
* Fixed reading of digital states from PI. 
* Added get_units() and get_descriptions() methods to fetch engineering units and description for
specified tags. 
* Enabled tag search by description.
* pyims.__version__ can be used to check package version.

# 0.0.8
* Improved documentation
* Added commonly requested documentation, including docstring, for specifying query method for 
read_tags.

# 0.0.7
* Fixed bug where timezone was fixed to Europe/Oslo
* Discovered that Pandas 0.23 is required. 0.22 causes a weird timezone bug during DST folds when 
using cache.

# 0.0.6
* Aspen now supports avg, min, max, rng, std and var queries. These currently have timestamps in 
the middle of the period.
* Started preparation for supporting more read types for both Aspen and PI.
* Defined max_rows = 100000 for PI to (hopefully) avoid timeouts.
* Fixed indexing issue (duplicate indices appeared in some cases, but are now removed).

# 0.0.5
* Now properly handles DST (Daylight savings time), both to and from. 
* Introduced time zones. Start- and stop time for queries are always performed relative to server 
time, so we have to know where the server is located. The default time zone is "Europe/Oslo", but 
this can be changed for e.g. Peregrino by specifying `tz="America/Sao_Paulo"` upon initialization 
of the client.
* Cache files produced with versions < 0.0.5 must be deleted.
* Queries should always return data for exactly `start_time <= time <= stop_time`. Off-by-one data 
(e.g. no data for `stop_time` or data for `stop_time+ts`) is a bug (except for PI queries with 
`stop_time` close to DST changes, in which case PI may act silly).
* Interpolated queries for IP.21 now return extrapolated values after last valid datapoint.
 
# 0.0.4 
* Fixed cache sorting issue when reading across two segments that were previously written in 
nonchronological order. 

# 0.0.3
* Added support for tags with mappings (relevant for SNA and SNB) by specifying tags on the form `tag;map`
* Fixed NaturalNameWarning when using '.' in tagnames

# 0.0.2
* Initial public release. Supports the most common tag read queries for IP.21 and PI.

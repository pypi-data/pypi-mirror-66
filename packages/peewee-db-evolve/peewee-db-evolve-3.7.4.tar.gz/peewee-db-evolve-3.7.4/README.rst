Peewee DB Evolve
================

Diffs your models against your database, and outputs SQL to
(non-destructively) update your schema.

Think of it as ``db.create_tables()`` on steriods (which doesn't drop
your database).

You can also think of it as schema migrations, without having to
actually write the migrations.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Run: ``sudo pip install peewee-db-evolve``
2. Add ``import peeweedbevolve`` anywhere before your models are
   defined.
3. Run ``db.evolve()`` where you would have normally run
   ``db.create_tables()``, and enjoy!

Example
-------

See our `Hello
World <https://github.com/keredson/peewee-db-evolve/tree/master/examples/hello_world>`__
example.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

*Does this work with existing projects, or only with new projects?*

This works very well with existing projects. If your API only works with
new projects, you're probably doing it wrong.

*Don't you give up control by not writing your own migrations?*

Managing your schema by writing your own migrations is kind of like
managing your source code by writing your own ``patch`` files in
addition to writing your actual code. A well vetted ``diff`` tool is
going to be better and faster at it than you.

*How old / well vetted is this tool?*

This project has been in production use since August 2016. (We switched
to Peewee as an ORM.) But it's a style of schema management I've been
using for ~10 years now.

*How can I prevent ``peewee-db-evolve`` from evolving a specific table
or class?*

In the class' ``Meta`` class, add ``evolve = False`` and
``peewee-db-evolve`` will ignore it. If you don't have a class for a
specific table, just make a do-nothing dummy class for it.

Description: You like the super-short try-until-succeed development cycle that comes from
        implementing code in a Jupyter notebook? You would also like to perform your
        development with a bit of discipline, writing repeatable unit and integration
        tests as you go? This Python package is for you.
        
        You can start your notebook by instantiating a test suite, and as you
        test-driven-develop your code (or something), you add tests to that suite.
        These tests are run as you go. The test suite accumulates your test results
        and can produce a report at the end. The package also includes an executable
        script that will take your notebook of tests as input, run it all from the
        command line, and write a nice result report to the shell -- or some raw test
        result data structure, if that's how you fly.

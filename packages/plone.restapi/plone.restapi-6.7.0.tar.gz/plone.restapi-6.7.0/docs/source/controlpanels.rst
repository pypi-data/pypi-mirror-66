Control Panels
==============

Control panels in Plone allow you to configure the global site setup of a
Plone site. The @controlpanels endpoint in plone.restapi allows you to list
all existing control panels in a Plone site and to retrieve or edit the
settings of a specific control panel.

Most of the settings in the Plone control panels are based on plone.registry (since Plone 5.x). Therefore you can also use the @registry endpoint to
retrieve or manipulate site settings. The @controlpanels endpoint just gives
developers are more a convenience way of accessing the settings and makes it
easier to render control panels on the front-end.


.. note:: This is currently only implemented for Plone 5.

    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_item.req

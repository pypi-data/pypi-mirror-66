Description: color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic color-grading
        of photographs, paintings, film sequences or light-fields. The methods behind the mappings are based on the
        Monge-Kantorovich solution as proposed by Pitie et al., the approach by Reinhard et al. and histogram matching.

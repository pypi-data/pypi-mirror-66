        # An API to the UCI Machine Learning Repository
        
        This is a python package to enable easy access to datasets
        in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Note that this is not
        an official API. Any usage of datasets should be cited
        according to instructions in the UCI Machine Learning
        Repository.
        
        The project is at an early alpha stage, so suggestion for
        changes or additions are very welcome.

        ## Basic usage
        
        ```
        from ucimlr import regression_datasets
        abalone = regression_datasets.Abalone('dataset_folder')
        print(abalone.type_)
        >>> regression
        print(len(abalone))
        >>> 3341
        ```
        
        Independent and dependent variables are accessed as
        numpy arrays:
        ```
        print(abalone.x.shape)
        >>> (3341, 10)
        print(abalone.y.shape)
        >>> (3341, 1)
        ```
        
        Or by element access:
        ```
        x, y = dataset[0]
        ```

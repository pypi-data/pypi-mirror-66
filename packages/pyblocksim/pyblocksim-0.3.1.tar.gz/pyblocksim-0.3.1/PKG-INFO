Description: Pyblocksim aims to mitigate the lack of a tool like Simulink (or scicos)
        in the world of python based scientific computing. It aims to enable an low-effort implementation
        of a model of a dynamical system which is composed of interconnected blocks such as rational
        transfer functions and static nonlinearities. Delay blocks are supported via ring-buffers
        and discrete states can also be emulated (e.g. for hysteresis).

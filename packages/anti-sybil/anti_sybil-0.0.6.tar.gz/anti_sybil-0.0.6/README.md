# BrightID Anti Sybil

This package provides a framework to generate different types of test graphs and to evaluate the quality of different anti sybil algorithms on them.

### Prerequisite

- Python3.7

### Install

```
pip install anti_sybil
```

### Web Based UI

Run `anti_sybil_server` in your terminal and then open `localhost:8082` in your browser.

### Anti-Sybil Algorithm Trials

We tested four different algorithms with different parameters. This was made possible through funding from Aragon. The documentation and output of these trials are below.

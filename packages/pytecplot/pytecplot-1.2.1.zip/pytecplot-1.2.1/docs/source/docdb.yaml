data:
    load:
        frame: >
            frame (`Frame`, optional): The `Frame` to attach the resulting
            `Dataset`. If `None`, the currently active `Frame` is used and the
            zones are appended by default.
    dataset:
        addzone: >
            .. warning:: **Setting connectivity in connected mode.**

                When connected to a running instance of Tecplot 360 using the
                TecUtil Server, care must be taken to ensure that the GUI does
                not try to render the data between the creation of the zone and
                the setting of the connectivity, through the `Facemap` or
                `Nodemap` objects. This can be achieved by setting the plot
                type of the frame(s) holding on to the dataset to
                `PlotType.Sketch` before creating the zone and only going to
                `PlotType.Cartesian3D` after the connectivity is set. Tecplot
                360 may get into a bad state, corrupting loaded data, if it
                attempts to render (especially polytope) data without
                connectivity.
        suspend: >
            .. note:: **Performance considerations for data manipulations.**

                When performing many data-manipulation operations including
                adding zones, adding variables, modifying field data or
                connectivity, and especially in connected mode, it is
                recommended to do this all with the
                `tecplot.session.suspend()`. This will prevent the Tecplot
                engine from trying to "keep up" with the changes. Tecplot will
                be notified of all changes made upon exit of this context. This
                may result in significant performance gains for long
                operations.
        numpy: >
            .. note:: **Data operations can make use of Numpy when installed.**

                When doing large data transfers into and out of Tecplot using
                PyTecplot, it is recommended to install the Python
                array-processing module `Numpy <https://scipy.org>`_. PyTecplot
                will automatically use this to optimize data transfers which
                may result in significant performance gains.

export:
    region: >
            region (`frame <Frame>` or `ExportRegion`, optional): If ``region``
            is a `frame object <Frame>`, then the contents of the frame will be
            exported. If region is `ExportRegion.CurrentFrame`, then the
            contents of the currently active frame will be exported. If region
            is `ExportRegion.AllFrames`, then the smallest rectangle containing
            all frames will be exported. If region is `ExportRegion.WorkArea`,
            then everything shown in the workspace will be exported. (default:
            `ExportRegion.AllFrames`)
    animation:
        context: >
            This is a `context manager
            <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers>`_
            and must be invoked using the `with
            <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with>`_
            statement. The returned object of the context manager is used to
            control when each frame of the video is captured. This is done
            using the context method `animation.export_animation_frame()` as
            shown in the example below, at which point the specified region or
            plot is rendered. The actual video file is produced upon exit of
            the context.
        filename: >
            filename (`str`): The resulting video file name or path, relative
            to Python's current working directory.
        width: >
            width (`int`, optional): The width of the video in pixels.
            (default: 800)
        animation_speed: >
            animation_speed (`int`, optional): The frame-rate of the video in
            frames per second. (default: 10)
        region: >
            region (`Frame` or `ExportRegion`, optional): The rectangular area
            to be exported. This can be a specific `Frame` object or one of
            `ExportRegion.CurrentFrame`, `ExportRegion.AllFrames` (default) or
            `ExportRegion.WorkArea`.
        supersample: >
            supersample (`int`, optional): Controls the amount of anti-aliasing
            used in each frame. Valid values are 1-16. A value of **1**
            indicates that no antialiasing will be used. Antialiasing smooths
            jagged edges on text, lines, and edges of the video output by the
            process of supersampling. *Some graphics cards* can cause Tecplot
            360 to crash when larger anti-aliasing values are used. If this
            occurs on your machine, try updating your graphics driver or using
            a lower anti-aliasing value. (default: **3**)
        multiple_color_tables: >
            multiple_color_tables (`bool`, optional): Create a color table for
            each frame of the animation. If `False` (default), the whole
            animation will be scanned in an attempt to create a single table of
            256 colors.
    time_animation:
        start_time: >
            start_time (`float`, optional): The beginning solution time of the
            animation. This defaults to the earliest solution time in the
            dataset.
        end_time: >
            end_time (`float`, optional): The ending solution time of the
            animation. This defaults to the latest solution time in the
            dataset.
        timestep_step: >
            timestep_step (`int`, optional): The number of timesteps to
            increments for each frame of the animation. (default: 1)

solution_time:
    update_by_gui: >
        .. note:: **Possible side-effect when connected to Tecplot 360.**

            Changing the solution times in the dataset or modifying the active
            fieldmaps in a frame may trigger a change in the active plot's
            solution time by the Tecplot 360 interface. This is done to keep
            the GUI controls consistent. In batch mode, no such side-effect
            will take place and the user must take care to set the plot's
            solution time with the `plot.solution_time
            <Cartesian3DFieldPlot.solution_time>` or `plot.solution_timestep
            <Cartesian3DFieldPlot.solution_timestep>` properties.

stringlist:
    newlines: >
        .. warning:: **Newlines in string identifiers may affect performance.**

            When iterating over many items by name, such as must be done when
            fetching an item via pattern matching, PyTecplot will optimize the
            search only if there are no newline characters in the searched
            items. Iterating over strings that contain newlines will be slower
            and therefore, it is best to avoid using newlines in
            string identifiers or names of objects such as `Zones
            <data_access>` or `Variables <Variable>`.

cwdnote: >
    .. note:: **Absolute and relative paths with PyTecplot**

        Relative paths, when used within the PyTecplot API are always from
        Python's current working directory which can be obtained by calling
        :func:`os.getcwd()`. This is true for batch and `connected
        <tecplot.session.connect()>` modes. One exception to this is paths
        within a macro command or file which will be relative to the |Tecplot
        Engine|'s home directory, which is typically the |Tecplot 360|
        installation directory. Finally, when connected to a remote (non-local)
        instance of Tecplot 360, only absolute paths are allowed.

        Note that backslashes must be escaped which is especially important for
        windows paths such as ``"C:\\\\Users"`` or ``"\\\\\\\\server\\\\path"``
        which will resolve to ``"C:\\Users"`` and ``"\\\\server\\path"``
        respectively. Alternatively, one may use Python's raw strings:
        ``r"C:\\Users"`` and ``r"\\\\server\\path"``

zoneorderingalert: >
    .. warning:: **Zone and variable ordering may change between releases**

        Due to possible changes in data loaders or data formats over time, the
        ordering of zones and variables may be different between versions of
        Tecplot 360. Therefore it is recommended to always reference zones
        and variables **by name** instead of by index.

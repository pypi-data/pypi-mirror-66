"""
The :mod:`proc.tree` module builds tree data structures based on process trees.

This module builds on top of :mod:`proc.core` to provide a tree data
structure that mirrors the process tree implied by the process information
reported by :func:`~proc.core.find_processes()` (specifically the
:attr:`~proc.core.Process.ppid` attributes). Here's a simple example that
shows how much code you need to find the `cron daemon`_, it's workers and the
children of those workers (cron jobs):

>>> from proc.tree import get_process_tree
>>> init = get_process_tree()
>>> cron_daemon = init.find(exe_name='cron')
>>> cron_workers = cron_daemon.children
>>> cron_jobs = cron_daemon.grandchildren

After the above five lines the ``cron_jobs`` variable will contain a collection
of :class:`ProcessNode` objects, one for each cron job that ``cron`` is
executing. The :mod:`proc.cron` module contains a more full fledged example
of using the :mod:`proc.tree` module.

    Process information including relationships that model the process tree.

    :class:`ProcessNode` is a subclass of :class:`~proc.core.Process`
    that adds relationships between processes to model the process tree as a
    tree data structure. This makes it easier and more intuitive to extract
    information from the process tree by analyzing the relationships:

    - To construct a tree you use :func:`get_process_tree()`. This function
      connects all of the nodes in the tree before returning the root node
      (this node represents init_).

    - To navigate the tree you can use the :attr:`parent`,
      :attr:`children`, :attr:`grandchildren` and :attr:`descendants`
      properties.

    - If you're looking for specific descendant processes consider using
      :func:`find()` or :func:`find_all()`.

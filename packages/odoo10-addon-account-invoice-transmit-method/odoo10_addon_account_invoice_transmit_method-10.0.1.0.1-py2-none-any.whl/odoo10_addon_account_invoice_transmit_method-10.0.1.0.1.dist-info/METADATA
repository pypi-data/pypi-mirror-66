=======================
Invoice Transmit Method
=======================

This module allows to configure an *Invoice Transmit Method* on each partner. This module provides by default 3 transmission methods:

* E-mail
* Post
* Customer Portal

You can manually create additionnal transmission methods or other modules can create additionnal transmission methods (for example, the module *l10n_fr_chorus* creates a specific transmission method *Chorus*, which is the e-invoicing plateform of the French administration).

Configuration
=============

If you need to add Transmit Methods, go to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Miscellaneous > Transmit Methods*.

Usage
=====

On the form view of a parent Partner (not a Contact), in the *Accounting* tab, there are 2 fields:

* Customer Invoice Transmission Method
* Vendor Invoice Reception Method

When you create an invoice, this value is automatically copied on the invoice (and can be modified).

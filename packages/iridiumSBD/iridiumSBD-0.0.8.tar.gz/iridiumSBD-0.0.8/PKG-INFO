        Communication system for Iridium Short Burst Data Service.
        
        A python package to handle direct IP communications with Iridium gateway.
        
        The goal here is to organize it as a standalone Python package with the objective to communicate binary data with Iridium Gateway. It does not try to understand the data being transmitted/received, but that task should be done by another resource. As a python package it is easier to install and update on different machines. With a small and specific objective it is easier to write tests and maintain it.
        
        This is part of a bigger project for IDG communication system with remote instruments as Spray and SOLO.

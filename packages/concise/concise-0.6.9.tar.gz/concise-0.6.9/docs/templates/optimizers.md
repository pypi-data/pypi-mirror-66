## Weight normalization

For convenience, the wight normalization code from <https://github.com/openai/weightnorm> was added to concise.

***Paper:*** *Weight Normalization: A Simple Reparameterization to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks, by Tim Salimans, and Diederik P. Kingma."*

Note: when using weight-normalization, the model should be initialized with `data_based_init` after compiling:

```python
model.compile(AdamWithweightnorm(), "mse")
data_based_init(model, input)
```

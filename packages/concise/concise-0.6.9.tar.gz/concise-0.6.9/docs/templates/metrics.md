`concise.metrics` provides a masked version of `keras.metrics` for classification (mask value = -1) and introduces additional metrics. ***Note:*** Be careful when using the additional metrics (`f1`, `precision`, ...). For those, the average accross minibatches is namely not equal to the metric evaluated on the whole dataset.

Description: Rerun buildout with a python provided by buildout
        =================================================
        
        Buildout 2.0 no-longer supports using multiple versions of Python in a
        single buildout. This extension makes it possible to use 'yet another
        single' version of python, by building a specified python part and its
        dependencies first then reinvoking buildout with the executable.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        A part to build python is required. You need to specify it by `python`
        parameter in `buildout` section, just same as buildout 1.x. The python
        section must provide executable option that gives the path to a Python
        executable.
        
        And add slapos.rebootstrap to `extensions` parameter in `buildout` section.
        
        Use whatever python to bootstrap and run buildout. If this extension
        detects that sys.executable used to run buildout is different than
        executable provided in python section, it will try to find this
        executable. If it does not exists, it will install this section and
        then reinstall buildout using new python executable. Later buildout
        run will continue using new python.
        
        Example profile and invocation
        ------------------------------
        ::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = slapos.rebootstrap
          python = slapospython
          
          parts =
            realrun
          
          [slapospython]
          recipe = plone.recipe.command
          stop-on-error = true
          bin_dir = ${buildout:parts-directory}/${:_buildout_section_name_}/bin
          executable = ${:bin_dir}/python
          command = mkdir -p ${:bin_dir} && cp -f /usr/bin/python ${:executable}
          
          [realrun]
          recipe = plone.recipe.command
          command =
            echo Running with python ${buildout:executable}
          update-command = ${:command}
        
        After bootstrapping and running this buildout it will print:
        
        Running with python /path/to/buildout/parts/slapospython/bin/python
        
        Running tests
        -------------
        
        Test for this package can be run as simple as:
        
         $ python setup.py test
        
        Please keep in mind that clean python environment is required -- the best one is
        provided by buildout or virtualenv *WITHOUT* site packages.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        4.5 (2020-04-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Add support for slapos.buildout >= 2.7.1+slapos004
        - Reset environment variables on rebootstrap
        
        
        4.4 (2020-02-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Add support for Python >= 3.6
        
        4.3 (2019-12-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Update zc.buildout dependency for 2.7.1+slapos*
        
        4.2 (2019-10-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Support python provided by a part that does not need install.
          This fixes installation of slapos software release which python comes
          already installed in shared parts from an outer slapos.
        
        4.1 (2017-06-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix MANIFEST.in: some files were missing.
        
        4.0 (2017-06-05)
        ----------------
        
        Complete reimplementation:
        
        - Work entirely in-place, even to switch to a different version of Python.
        - Update bin/buildout to immediately use the wanted Python on subsequent
          buildout runs.
        
        For SlapOS, the second point is required to have the instanciation done
        with the built Python.
        
        3.10 (2017-03-15)
        -----------------
        
        * Drop zc.buildout version pinning to prevent loop in case of version
          change.
        
        3.9 (2017-03-15)
        ----------------
        
        * Drop zc.buildout version pinning in reboot() to prevent loop in
          case of version change.
        
        3.8 (2017-03-13)
        ----------------
        
        * Use a dedicated rebootstrap directory only if
          buildout:rebootstrap-directory is set.
        
        3.7 (2016-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        * Preserve bin-directory for generate bin/buildout on the
          appropriate location.
        
        3.6 (2016-06-30)
        ----------------
        
        * Add more parameters for the use case with slapos.package.
        
        3.5 (2016-06-10)
        ----------------
        
        * Explicitly specify the python interpreter and the config file when
          invoking a new buildout process to build rebootstrap directory.
        
        3.4 (2016-06-10)
        ----------------
        
        * Use a dedicated buildout directory for building a rebootstrap
          python. The change in 3.2 was wrong because it causes infinite loop
          of rebootstrap and build for different version of python.
        
        3.3 (2016-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Ignore MissingSection exception in _uninstall_part().
        
        3.2 (2015-11-10)
        ----------------
        
        * Support zc.buildout >= 2.0.0.
        * Same parts directory as the normal buildout is used so that we can
          build faster and also make the code simpler.
        * Python part is now specified by `python` parameter in `buildout`
          section.
        * Restart automatically with the original python when running python
          part is removed.
        
        3.1 (2011-06-24)
        ----------------
        
        * Support eggs parameter in rebootstrap section in order to add additional
          eggs for rebootstrapped buildout.
        
        3.0 (2011-05-27)
        ----------------
        
        * Renamed from slapos.tool.rebootstrap 2.4

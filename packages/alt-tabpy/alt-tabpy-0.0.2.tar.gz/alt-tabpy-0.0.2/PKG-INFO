Description: # AltTabPy: An Easy Alternative to TabPy
        
        AltTabPy is a lightweight alternative to TabPy aimed at single user Desktop applications aiming to get up and running with Python and Tableau in tandem as fast as possible. It aims to be *zero-configuration* and can be set up in a few minutes. It also focuses on a much smaller subset of applications, leaving environment and module management as out of project scope.

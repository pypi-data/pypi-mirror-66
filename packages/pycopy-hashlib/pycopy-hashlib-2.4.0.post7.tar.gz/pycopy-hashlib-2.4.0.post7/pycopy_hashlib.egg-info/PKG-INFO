Description: This is a module ported from CPython standard library to be compatible with
        Pycopy project (https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy). Usually, this means
        applying small patches for features not supported (yet, or at all) in Pycopy.
        Sometimes, heavier changes are required. Note that PyPy modules are written
        with availability of vast resources in mind, and may not work for Pycopy ports
        with limited heap. If you are affected by such a case, please help reimplement
        the module from scratch.
Platform: UNKNOWN

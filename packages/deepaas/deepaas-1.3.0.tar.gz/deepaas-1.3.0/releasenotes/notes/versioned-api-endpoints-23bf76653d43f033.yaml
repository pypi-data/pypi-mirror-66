    This version introduces major changes in the API. We now support versioned
    API endpoints. Please read carefully before upgrading your models. Now the
    root endpoint will provide information about versions that are enabled, so
    the corresponding api versions will be available under ``/v1``, ``/v2``,
    etc.
features:
  - Support for multiple, versioned endpoints.
upgrade:
  - This change introduces an change in the URL that is being used to serve the
    v1 version of the API. Previous versions served this under ``/models``, the
    documentation into ``/`` and the OpenAPI specification under
    ``/swagger.json``. This change has moved each API version to ``/v1`` and
    ``v2``. The swagger documentation is in ``/doc`` and the OpenAPI spec is
    under ``/swagger.json``.

    Notes
    -----
    Several computation-heavy functions in Thermosteam and BioSTEAM are already marked as 'njitable'.
    This function serves to cut down the time required to perform Monte Carlo analysis.
    
    When running a simulation for the first time, the simulation will take much longer.
    However, every simulation after the first will be about 35% faster.

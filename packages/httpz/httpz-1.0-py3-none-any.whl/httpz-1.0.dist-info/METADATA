## httpz - A handy HTTP status code library

#### Installation

```shell script
pip install httpz
```

#### API

Get an HTTP status code

```pycon
>>> HTTPStatusCodes.get("200")
HTTPStatusCode(code=200, message=OK, description=The request has succeeded)
```

`HTTPStatusCode` objects have several useful attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Example |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |
| `code` | `int` | 200 |
| `message` | `str` | OK |
| `description` | `str` | The request has succeeded |
| `category` | `str` | successful |
| `webdav` | `bool` | `False` |
| `experimental` | `bool` | `False` |


For example:

```pycon
>>> code = HTTPStatusCodes.get("100")
>>> code.code
100
>>> code.message
'Continue'
>>> code.category
'informational'
>>> code.description
'This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue the request, or ignore the response if the request is already fi
nished'
```

Calling `to_dict()` on an `HTTPStatusCode` object will return a dict:

```pycon
>>> code = HTTPStatusCodes.get("200")
>>> code.to_dict()
{'description': 'The request has succeeded', 'code': 200, 'message': 'OK', 'webdav': False, 'category': 'successful'}
```

Get a list of `HTTPStatusCode` objects by category

```pycon
>>> HTTPStatusCodes.get_category("informational")
[HTTPStatusCode(code=100, message=Continue, description=This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue the reque
st, or ignore the response if the request is already finished), HTTPStatusCode(code=101, message=Switching Protocol, description=This code is sent in response to
an Upgrade request header from the client, and indicates the protocol the server is switching to), HTTPStatusCode(code=102, message=Processing, description=This c
ode indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet), HTTPStatusCode(code=103, message=Early Hints, descrip
tion=This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a respons
e)]
```

Categories:

- `informational` - 100 range
- `successful` - 200 range
- `redirection` - 300 range
- `client_error` - 400 range
- `server_error` - 500 range

An enum of categories is also available:

```pycon
>>> from httpz import HTTPStatusCodeCategory
>>> HTTPStatusCodeCategory.CLIENT_ERROR
<HTTPStatusCodeCategory.CLIENT_ERROR: 'client_error'>
>>> HTTPStatusCodeCategory.CLIENT_ERROR.value
'client_error'
```

An ordered list of all `HTTPStatusCode` objects (from low to high) can be obtained with:

```pycon
>>> from httpz import HTTPStatusCodes
>>> all_codes = HTTPStatusCodes.get_all()
>>> for status_code in all_codes:
...     print(status_code.code, status_code.message)

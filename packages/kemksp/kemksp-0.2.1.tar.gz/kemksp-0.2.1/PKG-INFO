Description: <h1>KEM</h1>
        
        Kem is a Python 3 based Programm to manage your Mods.
        You can add and remove mods to your libary and install and uninstall them afterwards.
        
        When you uninstall a mod it will only remove files which are only in the dependencys of this mod.
        so you can easily uninstall mods without watching out for dependencies of other mods.

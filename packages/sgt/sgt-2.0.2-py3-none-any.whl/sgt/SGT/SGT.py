class SGT():
    '''
    Compute embedding of a single or a collection of discrete item 
    sequences. A discrete item sequence is a sequence made from a set
    discrete elements, also known as alphabet set. For example,
    suppose the alphabet set is the set of roman letters, 
    {A, B, ..., Z}. This set is made of discrete elements. Examples of
    sequences from such a set are AABADDSA, UADSFJPFFFOIHOUGD, etc.
    Such sequence datasets are commonly found in online industry,
    for example, item purchase history, where the alphabet set is
    the set of all product items. Sequence datasets are abundant in
    bioinformatics as protein sequences.
    Using the embeddings created here, classification and clustering
    models can be built for sequence datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Input

    alphabets       Optional, except if mode is Spark. 
                    The set of alphabets that make up all 
                    the sequences in the dataset. If not passed, the
                    alphabet set is automatically computed as the 
                    unique set of elements that make all the sequences.
                    A list or 1d-array of the set of elements that make up the                               
                    sequences. For example, np.array(["A", "B", "C"].
                    If mode is 'spark', the alphabets are necessary.

    kappa           Tuning parameter, kappa > 0, to change the extraction of 
                    long-term dependency. Higher the value the lesser
                    the long-term dependency captured in the embedding.
                    Typical values for kappa are 1, 5, 10.

    lengthsensitive Default False. This is set to true if the embedding of
                    should have the information of the length of the sequence.
                    If set to false then the embedding of two sequences with
                    similar pattern but different lengths will be the same.
                    lengthsensitive = false is similar to length-normalization.
    
    flatten         Default True. If True the SGT embedding is flattened and returned as
                    a vector. Otherwise, it is returned as a matrix with the row and col
                    names same as the alphabets. The matrix form is used for            
                    interpretation purposes. Especially, to understand how the alphabets
                    are "related". Otherwise, for applying machine learning or deep
                    learning algorithms, the embedding vectors are required.
    
    mode            Choices in {'default', 'multiprocessing', 'spark'}.
    
    processors      Used if mode is 'multiprocessing'. By default, the 
                    number of processors used in multiprocessing is
                    number of available - 1.
    
    lazy            Used if mode is 'spark'. Default is False. If False,
                    the SGT embeddings are computed for each sequence
                    in the inputted RDD and returned as a list of 
                    embedding vectors. Otherwise, the RDD map is returned.

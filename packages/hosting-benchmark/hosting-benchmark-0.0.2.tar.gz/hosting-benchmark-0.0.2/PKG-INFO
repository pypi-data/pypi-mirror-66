Description: # hosting-benchmark
        
        A full web-hosting benchmark suite
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install using pip:
        
        ```shell script
        pip install hosting-benchmark
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The benchmark consists of two components:
        
        * A *server*, which is a set of PHP scripts that run the benchmark
        * A *client*, which is a cli (command line interface) tool used to run the 
          benchmark and collect/present the data.
          
        In order to run the benchmark, you need to install the server app. This is 
        fairly straightforward:
        
        * Create a MySQL database on your web hosting, note down the credentials
        * Run `hosting-benchmark archive` to prepare a ZIP archive with the server.
          You will be asked to provide your database credentials
        * Upload and extract the zip package to your web hosting http root directory
        * Run the benchmark using:
        
        ```shell script
        hosting-benchmark --hostname=https://example.com/ --count=10 --sleep=5 all
        ```
        
        To learn what the `--count` and `--sleep` flags do, please invoke
        `hosting-benchmark --help`.

### Support
Windows is supported only as the server (where the hotkeys will run) and a raspberry pi is required to run the detector.

## WARNING
This will download a copy of [AutoHotkey_H](https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/), a DLL version of [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com/)

## Building
To build the server, where hotkeys are run:
```
$ cd server
$ yarn
```

To build the detector:
```
$ cd detector
$ pip3 install -r required.txt
```

## Devices
**Server**: The device running the hotkeys sever, i.e. where the hot keys will be run

**Detecter**: Device that handles detection of key presses & which keyboard it is and sends this to the server


## Sofware used & inspiration

2Keys uses AutoHotkey_H (a DLL version of AutoHotkey): [https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/](https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/)

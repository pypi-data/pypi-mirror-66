# faxplus-api
This is the FAX.PLUS API v1 developed for third party developers and organizations. In order to have a better coding experience with this API, let's quickly go through some points:<br /><br /> - This API assumes **/accounts** as an entry point with the base url of **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1**. <br /><br /> - This API treats all date and times sent to it in requests as **UTC**. Also, all dates and times returned in responses are in **UTC**<br /><br /> - Once you have an access_token, you can easily send a request to the resource server with the base url of **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1** to access your permitted resources. As an example to get the user's profile info you would send a request to **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1/accounts/self** when **Authorization** header is set to **Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN** and custom header of **x-fax-clientid** is set to YOUR_CLIENT_ID

Note: this API is available to Enterprise clients only.

## Requirements.

Python 3.5+

## Getting Started

After [installing the library](#installation--usage), setting up your API access, and obtaining the token,
you can try running the following code snippet:

```python
import faxplus
from faxplus.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: fax_oauth
configuration = faxplus.Configuration()
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_client = faxplus.ApiClient(configuration)
api_client.set_default_header('x-fax-clientid', 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID')
api_instance = faxplus.AccountsApi(api_client)

try:
    # Get account information of all non-admin members of your corporate account.
    api_response = api_instance.get_accounts()
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling AccountsApi->get_accounts: %s\n" % e)
```

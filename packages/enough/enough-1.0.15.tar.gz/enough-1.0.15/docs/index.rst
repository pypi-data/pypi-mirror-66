==============================

The `Enough infrastructure
<http://lab.enough.community/main/enough-community>`_ are a set of
services (Forum, chat, shared storage, monitoring, backups, IDS, DNS,
etc.) to support the work of `the Enough community
<https://enough.community>`_. It is maintained by :doc:`individuals
<team>` organized `horizontally
<https://enough.community/blog/2018/07/20/manifesto/>`__. Anyone is
welcome to contribute: learn more in the :doc:`contribution guide
<contribute>`.

Enough is also suitable for organizations with a focus on human right
defenders and journalists. It can be used to create and maintain an
independant infrastructure.

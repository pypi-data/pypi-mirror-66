Tutorial

Here is presented usage of all functions in our package.:
* For more information look into our :ref:`Documentation`.
* For examples check our `topoly_tutorial project on GitHub <https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/>`_.

Whatever you want to do, start with importing topoly functions::

    >>from topoly import *

Accepted structures
====================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/knots_links.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_import_and_find.py/>`_.

If you want to analize some structure you need to pass it in apropriate format.
Topoly is flexible in this case and accepts few different formats:

From file:

* .xyz  -- three columns with coordinates, or four columns, first with index and others with coordinates,
* .pdb  -- standard format for protein structure data,
* .cif  -- standard format for crystallographic structure data,
* .math -- mathematica array format (nested curly-braced lists)

From variable:

* python nested lists,
* pdcode,
* emcode.

Importing a structure works the same way in each of topoly functions.


Knot, link, theta-curve and handcuff type identification (invariants calculation)      
==================================================================================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/knots_links.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_knots_links.py/>`_.

Documentation section: :ref:`doc_invariants`. 

In Topoly there is a number of knot invariant calculating functions, with only
one obligatory parameter, the structure itself::

    >>alexander(structure)
    >>jones(structure)   
    >>conway(structure) 
    >>homfly(structure)
    >>kauffman_bracket(structure)
    >>kauffman_polynomial(structure)
    >>blmho(structure)  
    >>yamada(structure)
    >>aps(structure)
    >>writhe(structure)

`writhe <https://topoly.cent.uw.edu.pl/documentation.html#topoly.writhe>`_, 
All of them have optional input paramters. Understanding their usage may be
crucial for using them. They can be divided into three categories, defining:

* how input chain should be closed (closure, tries),
* how structure should be simplified (reduce_method, max_cross),
* if and what subchains should be analysed (boundaries, matrix, level, matrix_plot).

.. _tutorial_closure:

Structure closing -- closure, tries 
-------------------------------------
If your input structure is a **closed chain** (or you want to connect directly
two endpoints of your structure), you need to pass closure=Closure.CLOSED 
(or closure=0) argument. 

If your structure is an **open chain**, then two endpoints of a structure `have to
be connected somehow 
<https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article-abstract/41/2/533/66520>`_. 
In that case Topoly creates a big sphere around the structure,
with the center at the geometric center of the structure. Then each of the structure's
endpoints are connected with a chosen point on the big sphere. Finally these
big sphere points are connected with a sphere arc. Thanks to this operation an open chain can be
closed. In short the algorithm performs the following steps:

whole structure -> structures last point -> first point on the big
sphere -> second point on the big sphere -> structures first point -> whole
structure.

.. figure:: _static/domykanie.png
    :scale: 70%
    :alt: Closure using a sphere
    
    Closure using a sphere (left) and direct closure (right).

In Topoly there are five slightly different methods of creating these two
points on the big sphere: three random and two deterministic. 

Deterministic closure:

* closure = Closure.MASS_CENTER (closure = 1) segments are added to two endpoints
  in the direction "going out of the center of mass";
* closure = Closure.DIRECTION (closure = 5) segments connecting each endpoint with a sphere
  are parallel and their direction is user defined.

Random closure:

* closure = Closure.TWO_POINTS (closure = 2): each endpoint is connected with 
  a different random point on the big sphere, **this is the default option**;
* closure = Closure.ONE_POINT (closure = 3): both endpoints are connected with the same 
  random point on the big sphere;
* closure = Closure.RAYS (closure = 4) like DIRECTION but direction is randomly chosen.

For random closure there is another parameter available: **tries** (default 
200). It specifies how many times the operation of closing and checking the topology must be
repeated. Naturally it requires longer computations, but also gives more accurate
information about the structure.

.. _tutorial_reduction:

Structure reduction -- reduce_method, max_cross 
-------------------------------------------------
After closing the structure, the second step of the algorithm is the creation of a 2D projection of the 3D
structure. The subsequent analysis is performed based on the crossings found on this 2D projection.
Many of such crossings can be reduced, because they do not change the topology of structure.
This is important, because the invariant's calculation time strongly depends on the number of crossings.

In knot theory such reductions are made using the Reidemeister moves.

.. figure:: _static/ReidemeisterMoves.gif
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: Reidemeister moves
    
    Three types of Reidemeister moves

There is another method: `KMT algorithm <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.460889>`_. 
This algorithm analyzes all triangles in a chain made by three consecutive 
points, and removes the middle point in case a given triangle is not 
intersected by any other segment of the chain. In effect, after a number of 
iterations, the initial chain is replaced by a shorter chain of the same
topological type.

.. figure:: _static/kmt.png
    :scale: 40%
    :alt: KMT algorithm
    
    Representation of KMT algorithm

In topoly there are three available reduction methods:

* reduce_method = ReduceMethod.KMT (reduce_method = 1)
* reduce_method = ReduceMethod.REIDEMEISTER (reduce_method = 2)
* reduce_method = ReduceMethod.EASY (reduce_method = 3)

Some complicated chains can still have many crossings after reduction. 
Calculation of their polynomial can last very long. For such situations there
is **max_cross** parameter (default 15). If number of crossings after the
reduction is larger than max_cross parameter, then the calculation is stopped.

.. _tutorial_subchain:

Subchain topology -- boundaries, matrix, density, level, matrix_plot
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the topology of parts of a chain, you can use **boundaries**
parameter. It accepts the indices of first and last desired aminoacids in the subchain. If
you are interested in multiple such subchains, you can pass a list of such lists i.e.::

    boundaries=[[10,30],[31,50],[10,50]]

will find topology of three subchains: indexes 10-30, indexes 31-50 and indexes
10-50.

If you are interested in the topology of a whole spectrum of possible subchains it
is even easier: just use **matrix** parameter (default False). This will make the algorithm
run the invariant for possible combinations of subchains of the orignal chain.
Consequently, this can take very long to compute, therefore, Topoly also contains the  **density** (default 1)
parameter which controls how precisely the space of all possible subchains will be explored.
For density=1 all possible subchains are checked. For higher values passed to the
density parameter, the number of atoms will be cut and analysed subsequently. After finding
a knot with probability higher than the **level** parameter (default 0), additional
subchains with a similar length will be checked. i.e.

I.e. lets say you pass a structure with 30 atoms, density=10 and level=30
parameter. Then subchains 1-30, 1-20, 1-10, 10-30, 10-20 and 20-30 are checked.
Imagine in 10-20 chain $3_1$ knot has been found with a probability of 50%. Then
9-20, 11-20, 10-19, 10-21 subchains are also checked. Operations are repeated until
no more knots with probability higher than 30% are found.

You can plot your matrix using the **matrix_plot** (default False).

Calculating invariants of conjoined structures                                  
===============================================
Documentation section: :ref:`doc_joined`. 

In our dictionary of topologies are mainly prime structures. You may want to
find polynomials of more complex structures: unjoined unions (U) and conjoined
unions (#) of prime structures. 

You need to create objects of your basic structures. Lets start with the 3_1 knot::

    >>knot_31 = getpoly('HOMFLYPT', '3_1')
    >>print(knot_31)
    [+3_1: [-1 0 -2 0 [0]]|[0]|1 0 [0], -3_1: [[0] 0 -2 0 -1]|[0]|[0] 0 1]

The output finds all subtpyes of 3_1 knot and gives a list of corresponding
structures. Each topology is represented by two values: 

* name (here +3_1, -3_1),
* code corresponding to coefficients of its polynomial. 

If you want to check what are polynomial coefficients of +3_1 U -3_1 
(unjoined union of knots) and +3_1 # -3_1 (conjoined knots) write::

    >>plus_31, minus_31 = knot_31
    >>plus_31 + minus_31
    +3_1 U -3_1: [[0]]|-2 0 -3 [0] 3 0 2|[0]|1 0 3 [0] -3 0 -1|[0]|-1 [0] 1
    >>plus_31 * minus_31
    +3_1 # -3_1: [2 0 [5] 0 2]|[0]|-1 0 [-4] 0 -1|[0]|[1]

Which are coefficients of HOMFLYPT polynomial of knot compositions. List of
such objects can be exported to a new dictionary file::

    >>exportpoly(polynomials, exportfile='new_polvalues.py')

Documentation section: :ref:`doc_joined`.

Gaussian Linking Number calculation (GLN)
=========================================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/GLN.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_GLN.py/>`_.

Documentation section: `GLN <https://topoly.cent.uw.edu.pl/documentation.html#topoly.gln>`_.
 
Gaussian linking number is a measure of how linked two chains are. If there are
two closed curves, then this number always is an integer::

    >>gln(structure1, structure2)
    -0.011

You can also calculate GLN of subchains::

    >>gln(structure1, structure2, chain1_boundary=[3,8], chain2_boundary=[5,16])
    0.372

Find maximal absolute value between all posible subchains of two subchains::

    >>gln(structure1, structure2, mode=GlnMode.MAX, max_density=1) 
    {'whole chains': [-0.011], 'subchain of chain 2': [-0.967, '13-24'], 
     'subchain of chain 1': [-0.249, '2-6'], 'local maximum': [-0.967, '1-12', '13-24']}

You can even create a matrix of GLN values between one chain and all possible
subchains of another chain::

    >>gln(structure1, structure2, mode=GlnMode.MATRIX)

#TODO
**MATRIX WILL BE HERE**


Lasso type identification (minimal surface calculation)
==========================================================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/lasso_minimal_surface.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_lasso_minimal_surface.py/>`_.

Documentation section: :ref:`doc_lasso`.

For checking type of lasso topology Topoly checks how many times a lasso loop is
pinned by a lasso tail. For checking if pinning happened, Topoly calculates the
`minimal surface spanned on lasso loop <https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36895>`_ 
and checks if it is crossed. For more information look at
`this subpage of LassoProt database. <https://lassoprot.cent.uw.edu.pl/lasso_detection>`_.

.. figure:: _static/min_surf.png
    :scale: 20%
    :alt: minimal surface

    Minimal surface on a exemplary frame. Similar structures are created by
    soap bubbles.

For checking lasso topology, input your structure and indices of first and last 
point of a loop.::

    >>lasso_type(structure, [1,30])
    {(1, 30): 'L+1N'}

Which means that through lasso loop with indices 1-30 tail crosses once. 
Symbols '+' and 'N' are connected with lasso orientation. For further 
explanation look at this `subpage of LassoProt database. 
<https://lassoprot.cent.uw.edu.pl/lasso_classification#lasso_type> _`

You can also get more precise output using parameter output_type::

    >>lasso_type(structure, [1,30], output_type=OutputTYpeLasso.MoreInfo)
    {(1, 12): {'class': 'L+2C', 'beforeN': [], 'beforeC': ['+25', '-27'], 
               'crossingsN': [], 'crossingsC': ['+25', '-27'], 
               'Area': 100.766, 'loop_length': 36.0001, 'Rg': 8.12732, 
               'smoothing_iterations': 0}}

If you are only interested in a shape of minimal surface, type::

    >>make_surface(structure, [1,30])
    [{'A': {'x': -5.796, 'y': -0.0, 'z': 0.0}, 'B': {'x': 0.0, 'y': 0.0, 'z': 0.0}, 'C': {'x': -5.019, 'y': 2.898, 'z': 0.0}}, {'A':{'x':...

to get a complete information about a mesh creating a minimal surface.


Random polygons generation
=============================
Documentation section: :ref:`doc_generate`.

You can generate equilateral random walks, random loops and structures composed
of them: lassos and handcuffs. Loop generation in these functions is based on 
`Jason Cantarellas work 
<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8113/49/27/275202/meta>`_. 
To generate such structures type::

    >>generate_walk(30, 100)           # 100 walks of length 30
    >>generate_loop(27, 100)           # 100 loops of length 27
    >>generate_lasso(12, 8, 100)       # 100 lassos with loop length of 12 and tail length of 8
    >>generate_handcuff([4,7], 5, 100) # 100 handcuffs with loops of length 4 and 7 and tail length of 5
    >>generate_link([4,7], 2, 100)     # 100 loop pairs of length 4 and 7 and distance between their geometric centers of 2


Visualization
=================
Documentation section: :ref:`doc_vis`.

You can see your structure using VMD or Pythons matplotlib.

If you want to view .xyz structure in VMD, type::

    >>xyz2vmd('file.xyz')

function converts .xyz file into .pdb structure file and .psf topology file.
To open them in vmd type::
    
    >>vmd file.pdb -psf file.psf                                              

If you want to view structure (using matplotlib) in any of possible format,
type::

   >>plot_graph(structure)


Data manipulation
==================
Documentation section: :ref:`doc_manipulation`.

There are four more functions:

* **find_matching** translating polynomial coefficient data to topology type,
* **reduce_structure** reducing a structure using Reidemeister moves/KMT algorithm (check :ref:`tutorial_reduction`),
* **close_curve** for closing an open curve (check :ref:`tutorial_closure`), 
* **translate_code** translating the structure between abstract codes like PDcode.
* **import_structure** returns a PDcode of a given topology

Examples of find_matching usage
-------------------------------
Type::

    >>find_matching('1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1', 'Yamada')
    '2^2_1'

You can also insert more complicated inputs like dictionary of polynomials with
their probabilities::

    >>find_matching({'1 -1 1': 0.8, '1 -3 1': 0.2}, 'Alexander')

or dictionary of probabilities for each subchain::

    >>find_matching({(0, 100): {'1 -1 1': 0.8, '1 -3 1': 0.2},(50, 100): {'1 -1 1': 0.3, '1': 0.7}},'Alexander')


Finding loops, theta-curves and handcuffs in structure
======================================================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/import_and_find.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_import_and_find.py/>`_.

Documentation section :ref:`doc_find`.

If you want to find loops, theta-curves or handcuffs in your structure,
type one of this functions::

    >>find_loops(structure)
    >>find_thetas(structure)
    >>find_handcuffs(structure)

To find the correspoding topology. **output_type** parameter gives control of 
selecting the output: python list, .xyz file or generator.


Matrix functions
================
Examples: `topoly_tutorial/matrices.py <https://https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/blob/master/_matrices.py/>`_.

Documentation section :ref:`doc_matrix`.

Matrix functions gives you more control over matrices created by gln or
invariant methods.

plot_matrix prints map after passing matrix created by gln or one of
invariant functions (conway, homfly, etc.). It has more plotting
parameters than them, giving you more control over printed output.

* find_spots(matrix) -- finds geometrical centers of each identified topology field.
* plot_matrix(matrix) -- plots map basing on given matrix. It has more plotting 
parameters than invariant calcluating functions, giving you more control over 
printed output. 
* translate_matrix(matrix) -- changes format of given matrix (to dictionary or 
list of lists)

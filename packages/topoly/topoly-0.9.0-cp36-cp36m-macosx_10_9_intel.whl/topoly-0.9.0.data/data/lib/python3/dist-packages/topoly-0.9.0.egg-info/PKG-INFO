Description: # Topoly
        
        Protein knots and lassos search tools from the INTERDISCIPLINARY LABORATORY of BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS MODELLING, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland
        
        This package provides a set of executable programs as well as a shared library with a Python 3 wrapper.

        ## Requirements
        1. Python 3 (3.5 or later)
        2. NumPy
        3. Matplotlib
        
        ## Installation as python PIP package 
        
        Install Topoly using the standard python package installer PIP:
        
        ``pip3 install topoly``
        
        Topoly can be installed without administrative privileges in the home folder of a particular user or in a Python
        Virtual Environment.
        In that case all files (binaries, documentation, libraries and python modules) will be installed in:
        
        ``$HOME/.local/``
        
        or ``venv/`` respectively.
        
        If you choose to install Topoly with administrative privileges then everything will be installed in:
        `/usr/local/`
        
        Please note that after the installation it is necessary to add the folder that contains libraries
        
        ## Installation as DEB, RPM, ZIP
        
        Topoly is also distributed as a DEB, RPM and ZIP package.
        
        DEB and RPM packages install the package to `/usr`, so binaries should be found in `/usr/bin`, libraries in `/usr/lib` 
        and the documentation in `/usr/share/doc`
        
        If you choose to install Topoly from a ZIP package please make sure that the libraries from the `lib` subfolder are 
        placed in a folder that is listed in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
        
        The Python wrappers are built as module extensions and therefore they require that the `lib` subfolder should be 
        added to your `PYTHONPATH` variable. 
        
        ## Testing
        
        To verify that the topoly is correctly installed please run the `runtests.sh` script located in `share/doc/topoly/test`. 
        (`/usr/share/doc/topoly/test` if installed from RPM or DEB)
        
        
        ## Using Topoly
        
        Please have a look at the tests in `share/doc/topoly/test` to see usage examples.

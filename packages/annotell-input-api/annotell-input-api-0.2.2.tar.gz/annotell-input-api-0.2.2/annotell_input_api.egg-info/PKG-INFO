Description: # Annotell Input Api
        
        Python 3 library providing access to Annotell Input Api 
        
        To install with pip run `pip install annotell-input-api`
        
        
        ## Example
        Set env ANNOTELL_CREDENTIALS to the credentials file provided to you by Annotell,
        see [annotell-auth](https://github.com/annotell/annotell-python/tree/master/annotell-auth).
        
        Once set, the easiest way to test if everything is working is to use the
        command line util `annoutil` (this is a part of the pip package). 
        ```console
        $ annoutil projects
        ```
        
        
        # Changelog
        
        All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
        
        ## [0.2.1] - 2020-04-17
        ### Added
        - Methods `get_datas_for_inputs_by_internal_ids` and `get_datas_for_inputs_by_external_ids` can be used to get which `Data` are part of an `Input`, useful in order to check which images, lidar-files have been uploaded. Both are also available in the CLI via :
        ```console
        $ annoutil inputs --get-datas <internal_ids>
        $ annoutil inputs-externalid --get-datas <external_ids>
        ```
        
        - Support has been added for `Kannala` camera types. Whenever adding calibration for `Kannala` undistortion coefficients must also be added.
        - Calibration is now represented as a class and is no longer just a dictionary, making it easier to understand how the Annotell format is structured and used.
        
        
        ## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-16
        ### Changed
        - Change constructor to disable legacy api token support and only accept an `auth` parameter
        
        ## [0.1.5] - 2020-04-07
        ### Added
        - Method `get_input_jobs_status` now accepts lists of internal_ids and external_ids as arguments.

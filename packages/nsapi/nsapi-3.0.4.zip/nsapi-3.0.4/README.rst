Installation
------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you already are inside a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nsapi

From Git
~~~~~~~~

Create a new virtualenv (if you are not already in one) and install the
necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/aquatix/ns-api.git
    cd ns-api
    mkvirtualenv ns-api
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Development in Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Git clone this repository, use vscode & docker to remote open in a dev container
`as explained in this howto <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers>`_.

As part of ns-notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, follow the installation instructions of `ns-notifications`_,
which makes extensive use of this library to serve notifications to for
example a smartphone. The requirements of both packages can be installed
in the same ``ns-notifications`` one mentioned in the project;
``ns-api`` will be installed through pip from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nsapi>`__.

Home Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The very useful `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_ home automation software `includes an integration for the ns-api <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nederlandse_spoorwegen/>`_. Be sure to check it out.

Also take a look at nsmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bart RÃ¶mgens created `a fascinating contour map called nsmaps <https://github.com/bartromgens/nsmaps>`_ based on ns-api. It visualises Dutch railways travel information with OpenLayer 3 contour maps to show how long it takes to get somewhere in the Netherlands by train and bicycle.

Example application
-------------------

For example, I use the library to push notifications about my route to
my phone through `Pushbullet <http://pushbullet.com>`__. The program I
use to do this has its own repository: `ns-notifications`_.

NS API key
~~~~~~~~~~

To actually be able to query the `Nederlandse Spoorwegen
API <https://apiportal.ns.nl/>`_, you `need to subscribe
<https://apiportal.ns.nl/products/NsApp>`_. This immediately
gives you a primary and secundary key you need for access.

The library uses the `reisinformatie API <https://apiportal.ns.nl/docs/services/reisinformatie-api/>`_. Here you can try the API for yourself (and look up station names, but the library has the get_stations() function for this too).

The API portal also `provides statistics on usage and errors <https://apiportal.ns.nl/Developer/Analytics>`_.

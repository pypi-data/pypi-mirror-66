Description: # Grafátko [gɾafɑtko]
        An app for creating and visualizing graphs and graph-related algorithms.

        ## Running Grafátko
        First, install the app by running `pip install grafatko`.
        Then you can simply run `grafatko` from a terminal of your choice.
        
        ## Controls
        
        
        ## Visualizing algorithms
        The app allows for visualising custom algorithms on the currently edited graph.
        Examples of valid programs can be found in the `examples/` folder.
        
        After creating a graph, you can go to `Algorithms -> Run` and select the one you want to run on the graph.
        The program then calls a function with the same name as the file, the only parameter being the `DrawableGraph` object to run the algorithm on.
        
        ## Importing/exporting graphs
        The app uses a simple format for importing and exporting graph.
        It consists of a list of vertices of the graph, with possible specifications to the direction and the weight of the given vertex.
        
        A single line has the format `n1 [direction] n2 [weight]`, where:
        - `n1` and `n2` are labels of the nodes forming the vertex, containing no whitespace characters
        - `[direction]` is used in directed graphs, and could be either `->` or `<-`
        - `[weight]` is used in weighted graphs, denotes the weight of the vertex
        
        Examples of valid graphs can be found in the `examples/` folder.

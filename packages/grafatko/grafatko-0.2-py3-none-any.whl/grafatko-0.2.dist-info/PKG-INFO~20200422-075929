        ## Installing the app
        Simply run `pip install grafatko`.
        
        ## Visualizing algorithms

        ## Import/export format
        The app uses a simple format for importing and exporting graph.
        It consists of a list of vertices of the graph.
        The syntax is as follows, with the values in square brackets being optional:
        
        `n1 [direction] n2 [weight]`, where
        - `n1` and `n2` are labels of the nodes forming the vertex
        - `[direction]` is used in directed graphs, and could be either `->` or `<-`
        - `[weight]` is the weight of the vertex
        
        Examples of valid graphs can be found in the `examples/` folder.
        Note that as long as the file is _not binary_, the extension doesn't matter.

# BibTex Extract and Populate

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]
[![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-link]
[![Python 3.7][python37-badge]][python37-link]

This utility extracts [BibTex] references (a.k.a *markers*) from a [(La)Tex]
file and copies entries from a source (a.k.a. *master* for this program) BibTex
file.  The use case is exporting all [BetterBibtex] entries to a file on your
file system, usually one that is updated as you add, remove and modify papers
in [Zotero].

**Note**:  While the use case was intended for use with Zoter and BetterBibtex,
it will work on any BibTex file.

The program does the following:
1. Parses some large master source BibTex file.
1. Parses a file or recursively all `.tex`, `.sty`, and `.cls` files
   recursively in a directory.
1. Copies the matching entries from the master source BibTex to standard out.

The program makes the assumption that the BibTex entry IDs are unique as the
matches are very loose when parsing the (La)Tex file.


## Obtaining

The easiest way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.bibstract
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Usage

This is a command line program written that has the following usage (also use
`--help`):

* Print IDs in a master source file BibTex file: `bibstract printbib -m <file.bib>`.
* Print cite references in a (La)Tex file: `bibstract printtex -t <file|directory>`
* Print IDs that will be exported from the BibTex file: `bibstract printexport -m <file.bib> -t <file|directory>`
* Export the matching entries to standard out: `bibstract export -m <file.bib> -t <file|directory>`

Note that `file.bib` is the BibTex file and the `-t` takes a file or directory
for where to find the file(s) that contain the citation references.

Description: # Python bot framework for Lexemes on Wikidata
        
        This is a small library to create bots, scripts and tools about Wikidata
        Lexemes. It's philosophy is to have a transparent thin layer on top of the
        internal datastuctures enriched with convenient functions without hiding the
        power of the access to the internals.
        
        LexData is still in beta phase and there fore some features are missing and
        functions might be renamed in future.
        
        The code of AitalvivemBot was used as a starting point, but probably theres not
        a single line of code that wasn't rewritten.
        
        Install from pypi:
        ```
         $ pip install LexData
        ```

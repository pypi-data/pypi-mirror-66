        Installation
        ============
        
        First, this requires Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. Are you still using Python 2? It
        reached end-of-life on January 1st, 2020_.
        
        Make a virtualenv_ and run ``pip install pds-deep-archive`` into it. Or use a buildout_
        or, if you absolutely must, install it into your system python you monster.
        This software depends on the lxml_ library which your Python installer should
        take care of, but your *system* will require ``libxml2`` 2.9.2 or later as
        well as ``libxsl2`` 1.1.28 or later.
        
        1. Download the tar.gz distribution
        
        2. Create a virtualenv and activate::
        
            bash> mkdir -p $HOME/.virtualenvs
            bash> virtualenv $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive
            bash> $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
        
        3. Use the downloaded tar.gz from step 1 and pip to install pds-deep-archive and all of its dependencies::
        
            (pds-deep-archive) bash> pip install pds.deeparchive-0.0.0.tar.gz
            
        4. You should now be able to run the deep archive utilities::
        
            (pds-deep-archive) bash> pds-deep-archive --help
            (pds-deep-archive) bash> aipgen --help
            (pds-deep-archive) bash> sipgen --help
        
        
        Build
        =====
        
        To build the software for distribution:
        
        1. Boostrap the buildout (if needed)::
        
            bash> python3 bootstrap.py
            bash> bin/buildout
        
        2. Create an install package::
        
            bash> buildout setup . sdist
        
        3. A tar.gz should now be available in the ``dist/`` directory for distribution.

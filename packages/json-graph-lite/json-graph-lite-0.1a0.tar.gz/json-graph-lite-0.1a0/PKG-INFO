Description: Lightweight library for JSON graph 
        ==================================
        
        A practical subset for:
        
        https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification
        
        Multigraphs are not supported.
        
        Code here follows some conventions from:
        
        https://github.com/jsongraph/jsongraph.py
        
        However, nothing substantial has been borrowed from there.
        
        The intention of json-graph-lite is to provide lightweight graph library, which serializes
        and deserializes graphs as JSON graph format.

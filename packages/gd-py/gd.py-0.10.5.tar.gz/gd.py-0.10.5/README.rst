gd.py is a library that provides its users ability to interact with servers of Geometry Dash.

Key Features
------------

- Modern Pythonic API
- High coverage of the supported Geometry Dash API
- Using ``async`` and ``await`` syntax

Installing
----------

**Python 3.6 or higher is required**

To install the library, you can just run the following command:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/OS X
    python3 -m pip install -U gd.py

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U gd.py

You can also install optional **aioconsole** package,
which can be used to run async functions in repl:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/OS X
    python3 -m pip install -U gd.py[console]

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U gd.py[console]

gd.py also provides an optional Cython extension to speed up its parser functions in
`gd.api <https://github.com/NeKitDS/gd.py/blob/master/gd/api>`_ folder,
so make sure that you have Cython and C++ Build Tools installed.

To install the developer version, run these commands:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/NeKitDS/gd.py
    $ cd gd.py
    $ python3 -m pip install -U .[dev]

Quick example
-------------

Below is an example of fetching a song by its ID.

.. code:: python

    import gd

    client = gd.Client()
    
    async def test():
        song = await client.get_song(633206)
        print(song.name)

    client.run(test())

    # OUTPUT: Random Song 01

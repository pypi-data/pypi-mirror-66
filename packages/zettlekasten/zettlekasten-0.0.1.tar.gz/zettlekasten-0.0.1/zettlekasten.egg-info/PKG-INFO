        > The Zettelkasten principles
        >
        > A Zettelkasten is a phenomenal tool for storing and organizing your
        > knowledge, extending your> memory, generating new connections
        > between ideas, and increasing your writing output. However, to make
        > the most of a Zettelkasten, you should follow some key principles.
        >
        > 1. The principle of atomicity: The term was coined by Christian
        >    Tietze. It means that each note should contain one idea and one
        >    idea only. This makes it possible to link ideas with a lase
        >    focus.
        >
        > 2. The principle of autonomy: Each note should be autonomous,
        >    meaning it should be self-contained and comprehensible on its
        >    own. This allows notes to be moved, processed, separated, and
        >    concatenated independently of its neighbors. It also ensures that
        >    notes remain useful even if the original source of information
        >    disappears.
        >
        > 3. Always link your notes: Whenever you add a note, make sure to
        >    link it to already existing notes. Avoid notes that are
        >    disconnected from other notes. As Luhmann himself put it, “each
        >    note is just an element that derives its quality from the network
        >    of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the
        >    network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten”
        >    (original in German).
        >
        > 4. Explain why you’re linking notes: Whenever you are connecting two
        >    notes by a link, make sure to briefly explain why you are linking
        >    them. Otherwise, years down the road when you revisit your notes,
        >    you may have no idea why you connected them.
        >
        > 5. Use your own words: Don’t copy and paste. If you come across an
        >    interesting idea and want to add it to your Zettelkasten, you
        >    must express that idea with your own words, in a way that you’ll
        >    be sure to understand years later. Don’t turn your Zettelkasten
        >    into a dump of copy-and-pasted information.
        >
        > 6. Keep references: Always add references to your notes so that you
        >    know where you got an idea from. This prevents plagiarism and
        >    makes it easy for you to revisit the original source later on.
        >
        > 7. Add your own thoughts to the Zettelkasten: If you have thoughts
        >    of your own, add them to the Zettelkasten as notes while keeping
        >    in mind the principle of atomicity, autonomy, and the need for
        >    linking.
        >
        > 8. Don’t worry about structure: Don’t worry about putting notes in
        >    neat folders or into unique preconceived categories. As Schmidt
        >    put it, in a Zettelkasten “there are no privileged positions” and
        >    “there is no top and no bottom.” The organization develops
        >    organically.
        >
        > 9. Add connection notes: As you begin to see connections among
        >    seemingly random notes, create connection notes, that is,
        >    specific notes whose purpose is to link together other notes and
        >    explain their relationship.
        >
        > 10. Add outline notes: As ideas begin to coalesce into themes,
        >     create outline notes. An outline note is a note that simply
        >     contains a sequence of links to other notes, putting those other
        >     notes into a particular order to create a story, narrative, or
        >     argument.
        >
        > 11. Never delete: Don’t delete old notes. Instead, link to new notes
        >     that explain what’s wrong with the old ones. In that way, your
        >     Zettelkasten will reflect how your thinking has evolved over
        >     time, which will prevent hindsight bias. Moreover, if you don’t
        >     delete, you might revisit old ideas that may turn out to be
        >     correct after all.
        >
        > 12. Add notes without fear: You can never have too much information
        >     in your Zettelkasten. At worst, you’ll add notes that won’t be
        >     of immediate use. But adding more notes will never break your
        >     Zettelkasten or interfere with its proper operation. Remember,
        >     Luhmann had 90,000 notes in his Zettelkasten!

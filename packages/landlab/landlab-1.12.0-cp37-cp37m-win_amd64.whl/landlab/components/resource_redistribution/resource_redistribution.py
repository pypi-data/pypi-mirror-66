class ResourceRedistribution(Component):
    """
    Landlab component that implements a two-state cellular automata
    model, that couples categorical vegetation (V) states and soil
    resource level (R), conceptualized by Ravi and D'Odorico (2009).

    Each cell in the RasterModelGrid object can take an integer from
    0 through 4 to represent the cell states for bare soil [0],
    grass [1], shrub [2], burnt grass [3], and burnt shrub [4].
    R is conceptualized to represent a soil resource value relative
    to the mean resource level of a productiive ecosystem (default:
    -2 to 2).

    There are four key process-representing methods in this
    component: establish(), mortality(), erode(), and deposit().
    re_adjust_resource() is a helpful utility function that helps
    limit R within the thresholds.

    resource redistribution and fertility island dynamics

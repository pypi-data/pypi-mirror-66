Description: Minigrad
        ==========
        
        An autograd engine inspired by Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) library. It is called mini because it is a little bit bigger than micrograd. Engine is implemented in Python C API so it is faster but more complex in terms of readability. Currently nn.py and micrograd.nn are the same but will implement it in Numpy.

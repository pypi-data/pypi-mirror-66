A set of **D**ata analysis tools in p**YTHON** 3.x.

Dython was designed with analysis usage in mind - meaning ease-of-use, functionality and readability are the core 
values of this library. Production-grade performance, on the other hand, were not considered.

### Version 0.5.0 is under way!
Work on the next version of Dython has begun. This includes fixes to open bugs, new features and a deterministic explicit API (removal of `kwargs` from methods). You can check project's status on the [Version 0.5.0 Project Page](https://github.com/shakedzy/dython/projects/1).

Bugs and features added from this point forward will be considered, but not guaranteed, to be a part of the new version.

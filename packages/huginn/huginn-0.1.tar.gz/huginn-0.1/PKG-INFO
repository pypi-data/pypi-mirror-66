        ## NYT API Usage
        
        This project requires the usage of the New York Times article search API.  Request a key at [](developer.nytimes.com). Create a file called `.env`, which should have one line of content:
        
        ```
        NYT_API_KEY=your_key_here
        ```
        
        This file is necessary for requesting relevant links for a potential Client entity's anomalies.

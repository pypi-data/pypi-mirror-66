Three types of oils S1 ({{g.A[0][0]}} €/l), S2 ({{g.A[0][1]}} €/l) and S3 ({{g.A[0][2]}} €/l)
shall be blended to produce an oil that costs {{"{0:.2f}".format(g.b[0])}} €/l,
which is cheaper than the expensive oil S1.
The other two oils shall make up {{int(-100*g.A[1][0])}}% of the volume of S1.
What are the respective portions of the oils rounded to full percentages?

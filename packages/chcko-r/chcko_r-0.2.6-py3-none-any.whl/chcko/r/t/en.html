The overall costs of a business are modeled with a quadratic function<br>
\[K(x)=ax^2+bx+c\]
The overheads (fixed costs) are known to be €{{g.cf}}.
With {{g.A[0][1]}} units the costs are €{{g.b[0]+g.cf}}
and with {{g.A[1][1]}} units they are €{{g.b[1]+g.cf}}.
Determine the coefficients a, b, c of the cost function and enter
them rounded to integers

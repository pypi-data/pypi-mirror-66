Intro
=====

Before we get started I would like to make sure you have all the
necessary requirements installed and give you an idea of which
knowledge you should already possess in order to follow along
without difficulty.

Requirements
------------

This guide assumes that you've already installed and configured Errbot
and have successfully managed to connect it to a chatting service
server. See :doc:`/user_guide/setup` if you have not yet managed to
install or start Errbot.

Prior knowledge
---------------

You can most definitely work with Errbot if you only have basic
Python knowledge, but you should know about data structures such as
dictionaries, tuples and lists, know what docstrings are and have
a basic understanding of decorators.

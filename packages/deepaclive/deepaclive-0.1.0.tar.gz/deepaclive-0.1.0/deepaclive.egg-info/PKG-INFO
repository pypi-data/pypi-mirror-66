Description: # DeePaC-Live
        A DeePaC plugin for real-time analysis of Illumina sequencing runs. Captures HiLive2 output and uses deep neural nets to
         detect novel pathogens directly from NGS reads. See also DeePaC main repo: https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/DeePaC
          and HiLive2 repo: https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/HiLive2.

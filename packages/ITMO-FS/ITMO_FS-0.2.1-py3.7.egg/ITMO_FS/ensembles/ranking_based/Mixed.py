class Mixed:
    """
    Performs feature selection based on several filters, selecting features this way:
    Get ranks from every filter from input. Then loops through, on every iteration=i 
    selects features on i position on every filter then shuffles them, then adds to result list
    without duplication, continues until specified number of features
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    filters: list of filter functions

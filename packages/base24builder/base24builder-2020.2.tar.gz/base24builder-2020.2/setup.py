If you want to use your own versions of these\nfiles (to exclude specific repositories, for example), you can prevent the\nbuilder from updating the source files by using the `-c/--custom` option.\n\nYou can use `-v/--verbose` for more detailed output.\n\n### Build\n\nBuilds base24 colorschemes for all schemes and templates.  This requires the\ndirectory structure and files created by the update operation to be present in\nthe working directory.  This operation accepts four parameters:\n\n- `-s/--scheme` restricts building to specific schemes\n\n  Can be specified more than once.  Each argument must match a scheme.\n  Wildcards can be used but must be escaped properly so they are not expanded\n  by the shell.\n\n- `-t/--template` restricts building to specific templates\n\n  Can be specified more than once.  Each argument must correspond to a folder\n  name in the templates directory.\n\n- `-o/--output` specifies a path where built colorschemes will be placed\n\n  If this option is not specified, an "output" folder in the current working\n  directory will be created and used.\n\n- `-v/--verbose` increases verbosity\n\n  With this option specified the builder prints out the name of each scheme as\n  it\'s built.\n\nExample:\n```bash\n./base24.py build -t dunst -s atelier-heath-light -o /tmp/output\n```\n\n### Inject\n\nThis operation provides an easier way to quickly insert a specific colorscheme\ninto one or more config files.  In order for the builder to locate the necessary\nfiles, this command relies on the folder structure created by the update\ncommand.  The command accepts two parameters:\n\n- `-s/--scheme` specifies the scheme you wish to inject\n\n  Refers to the scheme that should be inserted.  You can use wildcards and the\n  same restrictions as with update apply.  A pattern that matches more than one\n  scheme will cause an error.\n\n- `-f/--file` specifies the file(s) into which you wish the scheme to be\n  inserted\n\n  Can be specified more than once.  Each argument must be specified as a path\n  to a config file that features proper injection markers (see below).\n\nYou will need to prepare your configuration files so that the script knows where\nto insert the colorscheme.  This is done by including two lines in the file\n```bash\n# %%base24_template: TEMPLATE_NAME##SUBTEMPLATE_NAME %%\n\nEverything in-between these two lines will be replaced with the colorscheme.\n\n# %%base24_template_end%%\n```\n\nBoth lines can feature arbitrary characters before the first two percentage\nsigns.  This is so as to accomodate different commenting styles.  Both lines\nneed to end exactly as demonstrated above, however.  "TEMPLATE_NAME" and\n"SUBTEMPLATE_NAME" are the exception to this.  Replace TEMPLATE_NAME with the\nname of the template you wish to insert, for example "gnome-terminal".  This\nmust correspond to a folder in the templates directory.  Replace\nSUBTEMPLATE_NAME with the name of the subtemplate as it is defined at the\ntop level of the template\'s config.yaml file (see\n`file.md <https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/file.md>`_ for\ndetails), for example "default-256".  If you omit the subtemplate name (don\'t\nomit "##" though), "default" is assumed.\n\n\n\nSpecify the name of the scheme you wish to inject with the -s option.  Use the\n-f option for each file into which you want to inject the scheme.\n\nAs an example, here\'s the command I use to globally change the color scheme in\nall applications that support it:\n```bash\n./base24.py inject -s ocean -f ~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine -f ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc -f\n~/.config/i3/config -f ~/.config/termite/config -f ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc\n```\n\n### Exit\n\nThe program exits with exit code 1 if it encountered a general error and with\n2 if one or more build or update tasks produced a warning or an error.\n\n\n\n## Language information\n### Built for\nThis program has been written for Python 3 and has been tested with\nPython version 3.8.0 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/>.\n\n## Install Python on Windows\n### Chocolatey\n```powershell\nchoco install python\n```\n### Download\nTo install Python, go to <https://www.python.org/> and download the latest\nversion.\n\n## Install Python on Linux\n### Apt\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3.8\n```\n\n## How to run\n### With VSCode\n1.

Description: # dtControl: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms for Controller Representation
        
        ### System requirements 
        
        To run dtControl, you need Python 3.6.8 or higher with several libraries, namely numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, jinja2 and tqdm. This README explains how to install all of these on a Linux machine.
        
        
        ## Installing dtControl on your machine
        
        For most users, running
        
        ```
        $ pip install dtcontrol
        ```
        
        inside a new virtual environment (for details, see next section) should install the latest version of dtControl, as long as you have `python >= 3.6.8` and `pip` installed on your system (if not, install python by following the steps in the next section and try again). In case you have both `python2` as well as `python3` installed on your system, you might have to run `python3 -m pip install dtcontrol`.
        
        ### Manual Installation
        
        *Note: In case of difficulty when following any of the instructions in this section, please check the section 'Common Installation Issues' below*
        
        1. Make sure you have `python3.6.8` (or newer) and `pip3`
        
        Ubuntu 16.10 or newer:
        ```
        $ sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip
        ```
        
        MacOS:
        ```
        $ brew install python3
        ```
        
        2. We use a virtual environment to make sure that the installation is clean and easy, and does not interfere with the python packages installed in your system. Create a new folder `dtcontrol` and create a virtual environment inside it
        
        ```
        $ mkdir dtcontrol
        $ cd dtcontrol
        $ python3 -m venv venv
        ```
        
        to create a virtual environment for _dtControl_. This will create the folder `venv` inside your `dtcontrol` folder. To uninstall the tool, you can delete this folder and thereby all traces of the python packages you installed for using it.
        
        4. Run 
        
        ```
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        to enter the virtual environment. Run `python` and check that the displayed version is greater than 3.6.8 (if not, see (3) in the next section). Press Ctrl+D to exit the python console again.
        
        5. With the virtual environment activated, run 
        
        ```
        $ pip install dtcontrol
        ```
        
        This should install _dtControl_ and all its dependencies. Try running _dtControl_ by typing `dtcontrol` in the console. It should print the help text.
        
        
        ### Common Installation Issues
        
        1. If `sudo apt-get install python3.6` does not work, this might help you: https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get.
        2. In case of errors when trying to run `virtualenv`, check that it is located in a directory that is included in your path; this might help you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31133050/virtualenv-command-not-found.
        3. If you don't see what went wrong, leave the virtual environment (run "deactivate"), delete the folder `rm -rf ~/dtcontrol-venv` and go through all the installation steps again. If errors still occur, look at section *Fail safe: Virtual machine*.
        
        
        ## Running the experiments
        
        This section assumes you have installed _dtControl_ so that upon entering `dtcontrol` in your command line, the help text is displayed. Additionally it assumes that you have unzip-ed all examples in `./dtcontrol/examples`.
        
        Note that running all experiments may take several hours, or possibly run out of memory. A sensible subset of case studies which run quickly (less than 5 minutes per case study/algorithm combination) is: `cartpole`, `tworooms`, `10rooms` and `vehicle` (vehicle not for the linsvm method).
        
        To execute a single algorithm on a single model, run a command like
        ```
        $ dtcontrol --input ./dtcontrol/examples/cartpole.scs --use-preset maxfreq --timeout 30m
        ```
        
        More information can be found by running
        
        ```
        $ dtcontrol --help
        ```
        
        
        ## Reading the output
        
        To get an overview of the results, the file `benchmark.html` is created in the directory from which you call `dtcontrol`.  You can open it in any browser.

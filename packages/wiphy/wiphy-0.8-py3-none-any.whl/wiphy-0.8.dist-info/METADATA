# WiPhy

WiPhy is a Python package for wireless signal processing 
at the physical layer. This package attempts to facilitate 
reproducible research in wireless communications.

<!-- Specifically, it 
MIMO, OFDM
coherent and noncoherent detection
index modulation
Rayleigh and Rician channels
spatial modulation and differential spatial modulation.
BLAST, OSTBC, DUC-->


## Key Features
The major advantages of this package are highlighted as follows:
- **Incredibly fast.** It accelerates bit error ratio and average mutual information 
simulations by using a state-of-the-art Nvidia GPU and the massively parallel algorithms 
proposed in [1].
- **Numba friendly.** Different from the conventional IMToolkit, it dose not rely on any class 
and object-oriented programming. Thus, users are free from the nightmare of complex @jitclass decorations.
- **Highly reliable.** As with other high-quality packages, it has been maintained based on 
test-driven development. The simulation results have been used by IEEE journal papers.
- **Reproducible.** As given in examples, it is capable of reproducing results reported in 
a number of academic papers.

## Supported State-of-the-Art Concepts
- **Nonsquare differential signaling.**
- **Index modulation.**


## Disadvantages
- Some methods are not well documented.

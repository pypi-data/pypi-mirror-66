# ElectricPy
*Electrical-Engineering-for-Python*

Python Libraries with functions and constants related to electrical engineering.

The functions and constants that make up these modules represent a library of material compiled with the intent of being used primarily
for research, development, education, and exploration in the realm of electrical engineering.

Description: # McThings [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mcthings/badge/?version=latest)](https://mcthings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        A framework for building a Scene with Things implemented using the
        [Raspberry PI Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/)
        [API](https://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html). It is based
        on [mcpi library](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi).
        
        A Thing is a built based on blocks: [Pyramid](mcthings/pyramid.py), [River](mcthings/river.py),
        [House](mcthings/house.py), [Fence](mcthings/fence.py)
        and may others. All the Things share the [Thing API](mcthings/thing.py).
        
        A [Scene is a list](mcthings/scene.py) of Things built in a specific position. Scenes can be shared
        loading and saving them to a [files](tests/scene.mct). All the [tests](tests) are scenes. [This one](tests/scene.py) includes
        a river, a house in each side of the river and a bridge for crossing the river.

Description: DCE plugin for Quantiphyse
        ==========================
        
        This plugin provides modelling tools for DCE-MRI. Currently
        two implementations are provided - one based on the Tofts-Orton
        model and one using the Fabber Bayesian model fitting tool which
        supports both measured and population AIFs
        
        Quantiphyse and quantiphyse-fabber must be installed. To
        install the DCE plugin from PyPi use:
        
            pip install quantiphyse-dce
        
        The plugin will then be available from within Quantiphyse

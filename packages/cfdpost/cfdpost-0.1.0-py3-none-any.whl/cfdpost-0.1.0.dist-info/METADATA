# cfdpost

CFD post procedures.

## # post

    Frequently used CFD post procedures.

### [ post_foil_cfl3d ]

    post_foil_cfl3d(path, j0, j1, nHi=40, fname='feature2d.txt')

    Read in CFL3D foil result and extract flow features.
        path:   folder that contains the output files
        j0:     j index of the lower surface TE
        j1:     j index of the upper surface TE
        nHi:    maximum number of mesh points in k direction for boundary layer

    Single C-block cfl3d.prt index
        i : 1 - 1   symmetry plane
        j : 1 - nj  far field of lower surface TE to far field of upper surface TE
        k : 1 - nk  surface to far field

### [ feature_xfoil ]

    feature_xfoil(cst_u, cst_l, t, Minf, Re, AoA, n_crit=0.1, fname='feature-xfoil.txt')

    Evaluate by xfoil and extract features. 
        cst-u, cst-l:   list of upper/lower CST coefficients of the airfoil.
        t:              airfoil thickness or None
        Minf:           free stream Mach number for wall Mach number calculation
        Re, AoA (deg):  flight condition (s), float or list, for Xfoil
        n_crit:         critical amplification ratio for transition in xfoil
        fname:          output file

    Dependencies:
        cst_modeling, xfoil

        # GCMT3D
        
        This is the initial commit for the revisited global cmt solution to allow for 3D 
        velocity structures.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        In order to install GCMT3D we first need to create a new conda environment. 
        Then we install the dependencies, and finally GCMT3D itself. The required steps
        are the following.
        
        ##### First, make sure all necessary environment vairables are solved:
        
        Check whether an mpi compiler is installed:
        
        ```bash
        which mpicc # Shoud return the location of your mpi compiler
        ```
        if nothing is returned or the output says find then install a compiler.
        
        #### 1. Create and activate a new conda environment with python 3.7
        
        ```bash
        conda create -n <your_environment> python=3.7
        conda activate <your_environment>
        ```
        
        #### 2. Install separate dependencies:
        
        ```bash
        # Install basemap using conda
        conda config --add channels conda-forge
        conda install basemap
        conda install mpi4py
        ```
        
        #### 3. Download GCMT3D
        
        ```bash
        # Download GCMT3D
        git clone https://github.com/lsawade/GCMT3D.git
        cd GCMT3D/
        ```
        
        #### 4. Install other requirements using pip
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        
        #### 5. Install GCMT3D
        ```bash
        # Install GCMT3D in the current conda environment
        pip install .
        ```
        
        Test that GCMT3D was successfully installed by running the following command
        
        ```bash
        python -c "import gcmt3d"
        ```
        
        ## Travis automatic testing
        
        The Travis automatic system is setup to load the latest anaconda release for 
        Linux. Then, in a Python 3.7 environment, all required software is downloaded 
        and installed. For the installation steps, please refer to the `.travis.yml` in 
        the main directory. It mainly follows the steps in the quick install.

PySM Documentation
==================

This code generates full-sky simulations of Galactic foregrounds in intensity and polarization relevant for CMB experiments. The components simulated are: thermal dust, synchrotron, AME, free-free, and CMB at a given HEALPix $N_{side}$, with an option to integrate over a bandpass and to smooth with a given beam.

There is scope for a few options for the model for each component, attempting to be consistent with current data.

Currently much of the available data is limited in resolution at degree-scale. We therefore make efforts to provide reasonable small-scale simulations to extend the data to higher multipoles. The details of the procedures developed can be found in the accompanying paper.

If you are using this code please cite the PySM 2 paper `Thorne at al <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02841>`_

This code is based on the large-scale Galactic part of `Planck Sky Model <http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/~delabrou/PSM/psm.html>`_ (`Delabrouille 2012 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3675>`_) code and uses some of its inputs.

Models
------

Each model is identified with a letter and a number, the letter indicates the kind of emission and the number the type of model, generally in order of complexity starting at 1. For example for dust we start with `d1` based on Planck commander results, `d4` has 2 dust populations and `d6` implements a model of dust frequency decorrelation.

For example free-free:

    **f1**: We model the free-free emission using the analytic model assumed in the Commander fit to the Planck 2015 data (Draine 2011 Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium) to produce a degree-scale map of free-free emission at 30 GHz. We add small scales to this using a procedure outlined in the accompanying paper. This map is then scaled in frequency by applying a spatially constant power law index of -2.14.

Dependencies
============

PySM is written in Python and requires:

* `healpy`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `numba`
* `astropy`
* `toml`

In order to run in parallel with MPI, it also needs:

* `mpi4py`

To support distributed smoothing, it also requires:

* `libsharp`, see the `ci/install_libsharp.sh script <https://github.com/healpy/pysm/blob/master/ci/install_libsharp.sh>`_

Installation
============

PySM is a pure Python package, the easiest way to install the last release is to use `conda`::

    conda install -c conda-forge pysm3

or `pip`::

    pip install pysm3

Requirements
------------

See the `requirements.txt` file in the repository.

Libsharp
--------

MPI-Distributed smoothing (optional) requires `libsharp`, it is easiest to install the conda package::

    conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*openmpi*

It also has a `mpich` version::

    conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*mpich*

Install at NERSC
----------------

Optionally replace with a newer anaconda environment::

    module load python/3.7-anaconda-2019.10
    conda create -c conda-forge -n pysm pysm3 python=3.7 ipython
    conda activate pysm
    module unload python

Development install
-------------------

The development version is available in the `master` branch of the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/healpy/pysm>`_,
you can clone and install it with::

    pip install .

for a development installation, instead run::

    pip install -e .

Execute the unit tests with::

    pytest

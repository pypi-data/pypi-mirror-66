.. centered:: A simple, extensible backend for developing auto-tuning systems

Overview
========

* Free software: `MIT license <https://github.com/HDI-Project/BTB/blob/master/LICENSE>`_
* Documentation: https://HDI-Project.github.io/BTB
* Homepage: https://github.com/HDI-Project/BTB

*BTB* ("Bayesian Tuning and Bandits") is a simple, extensible backend for developing auto-tuning
systems such as AutoML. It provides an easy-to-use interface for *tuning* and *selection*.
This backend helps the tuning process of the hyperparameters for any given *objective_function*.
*BTB* is meant to fit within a user's existing workflow naturally enough that integration does not
requiere a lot of overhead.

History
-------

In its first iteration, in 2018, BTB was designed as an open source library that handles
the problems of tuning the hyperparameters of a machine learning pipeline, selecting
between multiple pipelines and recommending a pipeline. A good reference to see our design
rationale at that time is Laura Gustafsonâ€™s thesis, written under the supervision of
Kalyan Veeramachaneni:

* `Bayesian Tuning and Bandits`_.
  Laura Gustafson. Masters thesis, MIT EECS, 2018.

Later in 2018, Carles Sala joined the project to make it grow as a reliable open-source library
that would become part of a bigger software ecosystem designed to facilitate the development of
robust end-to-end solutions based on Machine Learning tools. This second iteration of our work
was presented in 2019 as part of the Machine Learning Bazaar:

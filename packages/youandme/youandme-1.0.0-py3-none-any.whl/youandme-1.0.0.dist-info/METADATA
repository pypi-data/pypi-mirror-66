# youandme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beardog108/youandme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beardog108/youandme)

Python library to share data anonymously and securely* with limited traffic metadata.

\* The ID one connects to a host with must be shared via a secure (private, authenticated) channel.

`$ pip install youandme`

# why

In normal socket connections, Eve can see when Alex and Bob communicate and the size of their communications.

This library sends continuous streams of data (null bytes) even when no information is being communicated, in order to increase unobservability of transmission times and packet sizes.

Anonymity and encryption is provided via Tor onion services, though this library could easily be adapted to use plaintext (and encryption by an application) or another relay like I2P.


# security

As stated above, this library does no authentication. However, if the ID is shared privately and safely, the tunnel will have roughly the security of a Tor v3 onion service, with increased metadata unobservability.

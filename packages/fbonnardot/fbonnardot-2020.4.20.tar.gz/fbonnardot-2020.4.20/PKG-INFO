Description: # fbonnardot - My python tools to do signal processing
        
        
        This module contains tools that I develop, adapt or translate to do signal processing with Python.
        
        Tools are organized into subfolders associated to themes (cyclostationarity, display, ...).
        
        You can install these tools with pip :
        
        	pip install fbonnardot
        
        *If you change or adapt a function, change its name (for example add your initial after the name)*
        
        These tools were made for :
        * personal work (http://frederic.bonnardot.free.fr),
        * my research work at [LASPI](https://laspi.univ-st-etienne.fr),
        * and for teaching at [IUT de ROANNE](https://iut-roanne.univ-st-etienne.fr).
        
        Do not consider these tools as perfect or free of error. They can help you but be critical about their results.

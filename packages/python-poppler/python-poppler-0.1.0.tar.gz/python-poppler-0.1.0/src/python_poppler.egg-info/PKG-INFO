        # python-poppler
        
        **python-poppler** is a Python binding to the poppler-cpp library. It allows to read, render, or modify PDF documents.
        More specifically, it currently allows to:
        - read an modify document meta data;
        - list and read embedded documents;
        - list the fonts used by the document;
        - search or extract text on a given page of the document;
        - render a page to a raw image;
        - get info about transitions effects between the pages;
        - read the table of contents of the document.
        
        
        
        # How to build
        
        This package is currently distributed as source only, and is currently tested on Linux only.
        It requires poppler 0.62 or higher (but 0.87 is recommended).
        I will provide a WIndows build once I figure out how to compile poppler for Windows.
        
        You need poppler-cpp with headers, python (3.7 or 3.8) with headers, and cmake.
        On Arch linux, you need the [poppler](https://security.archlinux.org/package/poppler) package.
        On Ubuntu, you need to install [libpoppler-cpp-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libpoppler-cpp-dev).
        
        The whole build process is handled by the `setup.py` file.
        
        For instance, to install in the current environment:
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        This will compile the binary packages, and install the library.
        
        Tests are run using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
        
        ```
        $ tox
        ```
        
        
        # Usage
        
        The package is installed as `poppler`. It follows the interface of `poppler-cpp`. Therefore, you can refer to the [documentation of the C++ library](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/api/cpp/namespacepoppler.html).
        
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from poppler import load_from_file, PageRenderer
        
        pdf_document = load_from_file("sample.pdf")
        page_1 = pdf_document.create_page(0)
        page_1_text = page_1.text()
        
        renderer = PageRenderer()
        image = renderer.render_page(page_1)
        image_data = image.data
        ```

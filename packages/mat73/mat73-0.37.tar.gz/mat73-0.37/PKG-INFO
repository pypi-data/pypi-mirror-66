Description: # mat 7.3
        Load MATLAB 7.3 .mat files into Python.
        
        Starting with MATLAB 7.3, `.mat` files have been changed to store as custom `hdf5` files.
        This means they cannot be loaded by `scipy.io.loadmat` any longer and raise.
        
        ```Python
        NotImplementedError: Please use HDF reader for matlab v7.3 files
        ```
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        This library loads MATLAB 7.3 HDF5 files into a Python dictionary.
        
        ```Python
        import mat73
        data_dict = mat73.loadmat('data.mat')
        ```
        
        As easy as that!
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install, run:
        ```
        pip install mat73
        ```
        
        Alternatively:
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/skjerns/mat7.3
        ```
        
        ## Short-comings
        
        - This library will __only__ load mat 7.3 files. For older versions use `scipy.io.loadmat`
        - `cell` objects are loaded as lists. That means they lose their structure and and need to be sorted manually
        - Proprietary MATLAB types (e.g `datetime`, `duriation`, etc) are not supported. If someone tells me how to convert them, I'll implement that
        - For now, you can't save anything back to the .mat. Let me know if you need this functionality, would be quick to implement.

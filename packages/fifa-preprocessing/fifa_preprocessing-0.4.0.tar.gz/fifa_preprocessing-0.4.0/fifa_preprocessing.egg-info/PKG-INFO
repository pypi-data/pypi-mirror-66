        ## General Info
        It was originally created to preprocess data from the EA Sports' FIFA 19 for a Machine Learning project to predict players' wages by regression. Therefore it contains functions that can be universally used for data preprocessing but also functions that are made specifically with the FIFA 19 data set in mind.
        
        ## Technologies
        It was written in Python 3.6 and requires 'pandas' to be installed in used environment. Also it requires 'matplotlib.pyplot' be installed if it is run as main.
        Used libraries:
        * math
        * pandas
        
        To install use:
        ```
        $ import math
        $ import pandas as pd
        ```
        ## Acknowledgements
        This project was created to use FIFA 19 data set, containing information about players in the game. It is strongly advised to use the same dataset to use this module to its full potential. The data set is shared by Karan Gadiya on https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19.
        The data set is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0International License][cc-by-nc-sa], which makes it unconvenientto include it in the package, because it would strongly constrain the possibilities to use this package.
        
        ## Running
        If program is run directly it will return a graph. 
        
        If being imported, it will display all possible functions.
        
        ## Functions
        Already done functions:
        * Loading data set from Fifa 19
        * Removing goalkeepers from data
        * Some data type converters
        
        ## Testing
        To execute tests on the mudule's functions run:
        ```
        $ python3 -m doctest -v preprocessing.py 
        ```
        
        ## Status
        Project is curently in progress.

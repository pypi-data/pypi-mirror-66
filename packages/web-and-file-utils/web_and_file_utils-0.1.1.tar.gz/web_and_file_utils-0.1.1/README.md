### `getstat` module
#### Import as : `from web_and_file_utils import getstat`
#### Methods Description:
* `urlstat_with_dirpath(directory_path)`
This method takes path of directories having .url files (Internet Shortcut files) as argument and creates a `res.txt` file containing the up/down status list of all the websites in the working directory.

 *Note: While entering path prefix a 'r'. For eg. r'C:\Users\yourname\dirname' should be given as argument*

 This method takes path of the file containing the list of URLs to be checked as argument. It creates a `res.txt` file containing the up/down status list of all the websites in the working directory.(Protocol should be present in the URLs in the file i.e. http, https etc should be mentioned)
 
*Note: While entering path prefix a 'r'. For eg. r'C:\Users\yourname\dirname' should be given as argument*

#### How to Call A Method : `getstat.urlstat_with_dirpath(directory_path)`

### `mailstat` module
#### Import as : `from web_and_file_utils import mailstat`
#### Methods Description:
* `urlstatmail_with_dirpath(directory_path,fromadd,toadd,pswd,smtphost)`
This method takes path of directories having .url files (Internet Shortcut files),sender's mail id, recipient's mail id,sender's mail password and smtp server address as arguments and automatically mail a `res.txt` file containing the up/down status list of all the websites in the working directory.

#### Methods Description:
* `urldictstat_with_dirpath(directory_path)`
This method takes path of directories having .url files (Internet Shortcut files) as argument and returns a dictionary containing the up/down status list of all the websites in the working directory , with website names as key and status as it's value.
 
 *Note: While entering path prefix a 'r'. For eg. r'C:\Users\yourname\dirname' should be given as argument*

#### Import as : `from web_and_file_utils import filepack`
#### Methods Description:
* `get_files_list(fpath,ext)`
This method takes a list of paths we want to get our files from, and the extension of those files as arguments.It creates `filelist.txt` in the working directory containing the paths of all the files with the given extension from all the given paths.

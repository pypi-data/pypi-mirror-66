,Abbreviation,Description,,Notes on Conditionally Required (CR) fields (to be used in conjunction with 'OED CR Field Appendix' tab):,,,,,,,,,
,Acc,Account,,"   Grouping format: most granular - CRx-xx-x-x, higher level group - CRx-xx-x, higher level group - CRx-xx, highest level groups - CRx, where x is a digit between 0 and 9.",,,,,,,,,
,Agg,Aggregate,,   Some conditionally required fields have just the highest level hierarchy group.,,,,,,,,,
,BI,Business Interruption,,"   If there is data in the most granular level group, then all the fields in that group and its higher levels must be included in the file too.",,,,,,,,,
,Cond,Condition,,,,,,,,,,,
,Cov,Coverage,,"   Example 1: if a user wants to include Policy Blanket Deductible, PolDed6All with Conditionally Required code: CR2-06-1",,,,,,,,,
,Ded,Deductible,,   Then the following logic is used to find additional fields that need to be populated:,,,,,,,,,
,Def,Defined,,,"Require all other fields with exactly the same conditionally required field, (CR2-06-1), i.e. PolDedType6All",,,,,,,,
,FX,Exchange,,,"Require all other fields with code CR2-06, i.e. PolDedCodeAll",,,,,,,,
,Geog,Geography,,,"Require all fields with code CR2, i.e. PolPeril",,,,,,,,
,LOB,Line of Business,,"   There are two fields with the last digit different (CR2-06-x), i.e. PolMinDed6All and PolMaxDed6All, that can be used with PolDed6All field, either individually or both.",,,,,,,,,
,Loc,Location,,,,,,,,,,,
,Max,Maximum,,"   Example 2: if a user wants to include Minimum Policy Blanket Deductible, PolminDed6All with Conditionally Required code: CR2-06-2",,,,,,,,,
,Min,Minimum,,   Then the following logic is used to find additional fields that need to be populated:,,,,,,,,,
,Occ,Occurrence,,,"As there are no other fields with the same level, then only the next hierarchical levels should be considered.",,,,,,,,
,Org,Original,,,"Require all other fields with code CR2-06, i.e. PolDedCodeAll",,,,,,,,
,PD,Property Damage,,,"Require all fields with code CR2, i.e. PolPeril",,,,,,,,
,POI,Period of Indemnity,,,,,,,,,,,
,Pol,Policy,,"   Example 3: to define reinsurance scope, at least one field in CR6-xx group must be present. If a user wants to filter by Location Number (LocNumber) with Conditionally Required field: CR6-01-1-3",,,,,,,,,
,Port,Portfolio,,   Then the following logic is used to find additional fields that need to be populated:,,,,,,,,,
,Reins,Reinsurance,,,"Require all other fields with code CR6-01-1, i.e. AccNumber",,,,,,,,
,TIV,Total Insurable Value,,,"Require all fields with code CR6-01, i.e. PortNumber",,,,,,,,
,Vuln,Vulnerability,,"   Any additional fields within CR6-xx-x-x group can also be added (or in the higher levels), as required.",,,,,,,,,

Description: # Introduction:
        This is a small python module to design a singleton class python (will add more later on).I have been using python for 2 years and fell in love with it and I would really love to give something (even as small as this module) to the community. If you like it give it a start,hate it tell me why I will try to fix it and you could help too.

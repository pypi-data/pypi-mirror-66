    $ pip install dob

The best way to learn ``dob`` is to run the demo:

.. code-block:: sh

  we already plan to fix. So please be patient!

  (You may see progress by fits and starts, but *it'll happen.*)

* Please be aware that real humans have only tested the alpha code
  on *Debian Linux* (technically, `Linux Mint <https://linuxmint.com/>`_).

  *We'll verify macOS and Windows support as part of the alpha cycle.*

``dob`` is a developer's tool, or at least targeted to someone whoâ€™s
comfortable in the terminal.

``dob`` is perfect for the person who asks,
*Why must I use my mouse to manage time tracking?*

``dob`` is inspired by
`Hamster <https://projecthamster.wordpress.com/>`__,
a beloved but aged time tracking application for
`GNOME <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME>`__.

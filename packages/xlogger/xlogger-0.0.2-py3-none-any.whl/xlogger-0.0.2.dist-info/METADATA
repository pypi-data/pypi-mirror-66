# Something about xlogger
I'm a python starter, when I learn the logging section, 
I thought that writing the logging format is so 'non-python',
and I have to write the same 'anti-human' codes every where.
Logs are important and should be used more. And in more simple way.

So I checked StackOverflow for some inspiration, and I actually learned some.

Here is the module I made, in fact, it's the first one I wrote that should be
shared at pypi I thought.

Hope you guys enjoy it:)

## Usage
just copy the code, it have no dependencies. this is the way recommended, 
because you can make your own logger customized easily by setting some variables.

or if you want to install
```batch
pip3 install xlogger 
```

then add lines to your code:
```python
from xlogger import xlogger

logger = xlogger.get_my_logger(__name__)
```
and then just use logger as usual.

Description: ## Getting Started with makeflaskreact
        
        I wanted to make a commmand line tool to easily generate a flask app that will work with React's cors issues
        because I have to rebuild this a lot.
        
        To run `$ pip install makeflaskreact`
        then  `$ makeflaskreact`
        optionally you could add a `FOLDER_NAME` and `API_PATH` name in that order.
        the default folder name will be `server` and the default api path will be `/api/`

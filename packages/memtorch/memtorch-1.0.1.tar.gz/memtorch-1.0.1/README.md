MemTorch is a *Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems* which integrates directly with the well-known *PyTorch* Machine Learning (ML) library, which is presented in *MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems*.

## Installation
 To install MemTorch from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/coreylammie/MemTorch
cd MemTorch
python setup.py install
```

*If CUDA is True in setup.py, CUDA Toolkit 10.1 and Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required. If CUDA is False in setup.py, Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required.*

Alternatively, MemTorch can be installed using the *pip* package-management system:

```
pip install memtorch # Supports CUDA and normal operation
pip install memtorch-cpu # Supports normal operation
```

## API & Example Usage
A complete API is avaliable [here](https://memtorch.readthedocs.io/). To learn how to use MemTorch, and to reproduce results of ‘*MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems*’, we provide numerous Jupyter notebooks [here](memtorch/examples).

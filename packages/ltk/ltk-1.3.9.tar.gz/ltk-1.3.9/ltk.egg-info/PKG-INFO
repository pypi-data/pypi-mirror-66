Description: Lingotek Filesystem Connector
        =============================
        
        The Lingotek Filesystem Connector (``ltk``) links your files and folders
        to the Translation Network™. It provides yet another way for
        continuously globalizing all of your translatable content.
        
        The Lingotek Filesystem Connector allows you to quickly add content,
        request translations, and pull translations from the Lingotek Cloud. It
        can even be quickly setup to automate the entire process by watching
        files or folders for new translatable content.
        
        Content can be sent up in any a variety of formats including: ``csv``,
        ``dita``, ``ditamap``, ``docx``, ``doxygen``, ``dtd``, ``excel``,
        ``html``, ``idml``, ``java_properties``, ``json``, ``odp``, ``ods``,
        ``odt``, ``pdf``, ``plaintext``, ``po``, ``pptx``, ``ppt``,
        ``rails_yaml``, ``resx``, ``rtf``, ``subtitle_rip``, ``table``, ``ts``,
        ``xliff``, and ``xml``.
        
        Developers love how easily it can be used to interact with the
        Translation Network™. Using the ``-v`` and ``-vv`` switches shows
        exactly which API calls are being used to help developers code custom
        connectors.

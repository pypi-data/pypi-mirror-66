        About openEPDA
        ==============
        
        openEPDAâ„¢ is a collection of open standards to be used in electronic-photonic
        design automation. These include definition of data interchange formats to
        facilitate Foundry PDK distribution and easier simulation and measurement
        data exchange between the parties involved in the PIC design chain.
        Specification of the formats and the roadmap are available at
        http://openepda.org/
        
        openepda package includes python-definitions of these standards,
        reader/writers for the files, and other useful tooling.

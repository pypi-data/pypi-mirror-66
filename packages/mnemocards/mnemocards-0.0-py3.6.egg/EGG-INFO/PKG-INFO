        Text files are easily maintainable, `apkg` files are not.
        You can easily store text files in a version control system like *git*, so you
        can easily keep track of changes and collaborate with others.
        
        Mnemocards comes with some pre-design formats:
        
         * **Language cards** (first row of the last picture):
         Specially designed for learning a language.
         There are two types of language cards:
           * **Vocabulary cards** (right):
           Cards displayed in 2 languages, your native language and the language you
           are learning.
           This type of card gives you the possibility to auto-generate pronunciation
           audios directly from Google Translator.
           Also, if you are learning Japanese you can use ふりがな (furigana, the
           small hiragana characters on top of the Kanji)!
           * **Expression cards** (left):
           When you already know a language and want to master it, sometimes it is no
           longer enough to translate into your language, but you want to write
           sentences in the language you are learning with their respective explanation
           also in the language you are learning.
         * **Markdown cards** (second row):
         Cards generated from `*.cards` files.
         This file format has been created specifically for the creation of cards with
         Mnemocards.
         Apart from a pair of start and end of card markers, the syntax of these files
         is pure Markdown.
         You can use images, Latex and math in this kind of cards.
        
        
        # Requirements
        
         * PyAudio, on of the Python dependencies requires you to install the next
         Ubuntu package: `portaudio19-dev=19.6.0-1`.
         Maybe any other version of the package is working but that one is the one
         I'm using without problems.
         Install the package with `apt install portaudio19-dev=19.6.0-1`.
         * **Python 3** and all the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
         All these requirements are automatically installed when you install the
         package with `python setup.py install`.
         If you want to install the requirements manually just use:
         `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
         * If you want to **import automatically the generated packages**, you should
         have **Anki** installed.
         * If you want to **generate cards from your repositories or gists** you should
         have **Git** installed.
         Install it (in Ubuntu-like systems) with `apt-get install git`.
         Also, in order to use the GitHub API you should have a file with and API key
         with gists/repository permissions.
         The repository permission is only needed for private repositories.
        
        
        # Install
        
        Clone this repository, move to the root of the project and run:
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Consider the option of [using Docker](#docker) if you do not want to install
        the package and to set up all the needed environment.
        
        
        # Generate cards
        
        The process of generating Anki's `*.apkg` files is based on the use of
        configuration files.

        # *Git* utilities
        
        In order to keep my cards safe and centralize my knowledge database, I added a
        few utilities to `mnemocards` to clone and push many *GitHub* repositories at
        the same time.
        
        ```
        mnemocards github
        ```
        
        ```
        mnemocards pull
        ```
        
        ```
        mnemocards push
        ```
        
        
        # Docker
        
        A *Docker* image is available so that you can generate your packages without
        having to install the package in your environment.
        At the moment you need to have *Anki* installed locally.
        
        The name of the image is `guiferviz/mnemocards`.
        Find more information about it in:
        https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/guiferviz/mnemocards.
        
        
        # VIM syntax file for `*.cards`
        
        I'm a die-hard VIM user, for that reason I've created a `cards.vim` syntax
        file.
        It's not too fancy (I would like to add syntax color to the header of the
        cards in the future) but it looks better than using the Markdown syntax.

        I also use the [Markdown Preview][1] plugin so I can see how my cards look like
        without generating the package.
        It's not perfect for the `*.cards` format, but it's better than nothing :)

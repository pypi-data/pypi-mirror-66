Description: 
        Beep is software designed to support Battery Estimation and Early Prediction
        of cycle life corresponding to the research of the
        [d3batt program](https://d3batt.mit.edu/) and the
        [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/accelerated-materials-design-and-discovery/).
        
        
        Beep enables parsing and handing of electrochemical battery cycling data
        via data objects reflecting cycling run data, experimental protocols,
        featurization, and modeling of cycle life.  Currently beep supports
        arbin and maccor cyclers.

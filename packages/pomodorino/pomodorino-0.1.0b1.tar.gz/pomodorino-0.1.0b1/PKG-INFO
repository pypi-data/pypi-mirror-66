# Pomodorino

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Pomodorino is a lightweight, simple Pomodoro timer desktop application
written using Python 3 and GTK 3.

What sets it apart is that it’s totally FOSS (licensed under GPLv3+)
and really lightweight.  Alternative Linux apps that I could find were
either paid and proprietrary or they used rather heavy technologies
like Electron.

Using Pomodorino should be rather straight-forward if you know about
the [Pomodoro
Technique®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) (which
is a registered trademark of Francesco Cirillo).

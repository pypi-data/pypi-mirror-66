        # My Python Project
        
        ## Description
        A simple tool to create a project with Python, an executable and an installer. It was inspired from [fbs](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs).
        
        For now, it's only for Windows, but future versions will make it independent of the operating system.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `mpp` can be installed using the pip package manager:
        ```
        $ pip install mpp
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Start a project easily
        ```
        $ mpp setup
        What is your project name? [default] Project
        What is your author name? [username] Name
        Do you want to display the console (y/n)? [y]
        
        The project version is 0.0.0
        The project's icon is here: resources/images/icon.ico.
        The `main.py` file can now be edited.
        
        Use `mpp --help` to display all possible commands
        Use `mpp <command> -h` to display the help for a command.
        Use `mpp config --list` to show your project settings.
        ```

        ### Show your configuration
        ```
        $ mpp config --list
         -â†’ name = Project
         -â†’ author = Name
         -â†’ version = 0.0.0

         -â†’ icon = resources/images/icon.ico
         -â†’ hidden-imports = []
        ```
        
        ### Edit your configuration
        ```
        $ mpp config author version
        What is your author name? [Name] John
        What is the new version? [0.0.0] 0.0.1
        
        Are you sure of your modifications (y/n)? y
        ```
        
        ### Freeze your project with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
        
        If `PyInstaller` is not installed, `mpp` asks if it can do it for you.
        ```
        $ mpp freeze
        It seems that PyInstaller is not installed.
        Please, consider using `pip install PyInstaller`.
        Current pip is path/to/pip.
        Do you want to install it now (y/n)? [y]
        [pip output]
        
        [PyInstaller outpout]
        
        Executable can be found here: target/Project/Project.exe
        ```
        
        ### Create an installer for your project with [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page)
        
        If `ShellExecAsUSer.dll` is not in the `installer` folder, `mpp` asks if it can download it for you
        ```
        $ mpp installer
        NSIS needs "ShellExecAsUser" in order to create the installer.
        Do you want to download it (y/n)? [y]
        
        Downloading... Done
        [NSIS output]
        
        Installer can be found here: target/Project_setup.exe
        ```

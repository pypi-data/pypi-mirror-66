Description: # MMF
        
        MMF is a modular framework for vision and language multimodal research. Built on top of PyTorch, it features:
        
        - **Multi-Tasking**: Support for multi-tasking which allows training on multiple dataset together.
        - **Datasets**: Includes support for various datasets built-in including VQA, VizWiz, TextVQA, VisualDialog and COCO Captioning.
        - **Modules**: Provides implementations for many commonly used layers in vision and language domain
        - **Distributed**: Support for distributed training based on DataParallel as well as DistributedDataParallel.
        - **Unopinionated**: Unopinionated about the dataset and model implementations built on top of it.
        - **Customization**: Custom losses, metrics, scheduling, optimizers, tensorboard; suits all your custom needs.
        
        You can use MMF to **_bootstrap_** for your next vision and language multimodal research project.
        
        MMF can also act as **starter codebase** for challenges around vision and
        language datasets (TextVQA challenge, VQA challenge)

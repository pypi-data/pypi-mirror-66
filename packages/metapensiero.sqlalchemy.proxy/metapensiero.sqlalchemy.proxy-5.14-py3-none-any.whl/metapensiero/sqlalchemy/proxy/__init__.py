"""
This module implements some facilities that makes it very easy to
rework arbitrary SQLAlchemy queries applying some filter conditions,
constraining the actual selected columns, batched results, obtaining a
meta description of the resultset, eventually marshalled in JSON, or
as a list of plain dictionaries instead of the SQLAlchemy rows, and so
on.

Description: # unidic-py
        
        This is a version of [UniDic](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/) packaged for use
        with pip. 
        
        Currently it supports 2.3.0, the latest version of UniDic. **Note this will
        take up 1GB on disk after install and can take a long time to download.** If
        you want a small package, try
        [unidic-lite](https://github.com/polm/unidic-lite).
        
        After installing via pip, you need to download the dictionary using the
        following command:
        
            python -m unidic download
        
        Example use with [fugashi](https://github.com/polm/fugashi), though [mecab-python3](https://github.com/samurait/mecab-python3) works the same way:
        
            import fugashi
            import unidic
            tagger = fugashi.Tagger('-d{}'.format(unidic.DICDIR))
            # that's it!

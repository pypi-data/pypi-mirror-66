        *gwf* is a flexible, pragmatic workflow tool for building and running large,
        scientific workflows. It runs on Python 3.5+ and is developed at the
        Bioinformatics Research Centre (BiRC), Aarhus University.
        
        Examples
          To get a feeling for what a *gwf* workflow looks like, have a look at a few
          `examples`_.
        
        Getting started
          To quickly get started writing workflows in *gwf* you can read the
          `User's Guide`_.
        
        Extending
          We don't have the backend you need to run your workflow on your cluster?
          See the `Writing Backends`_ section to roll your own.
        
        Contributing
          We aim to make *gwf* a community developed project. Learn how to
          `contribute`_.

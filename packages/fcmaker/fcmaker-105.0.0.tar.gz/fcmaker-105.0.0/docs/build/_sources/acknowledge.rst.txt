Acknowledging fcmaker
=====================

1) Only use lower case letters when mentioning fcmaker, and always include the version number.
   Ideally, you should also include a) the DOI associated with any of the Github releases, 
   and b) the code's `ASCL entry number <https://ascl.net/1806.027>`_, e.g.:
   
   fcmaker |version|: |DOI_latest| |ascl|
    
-----
   
2) If you use fcmaker for your observations (and remember that you did so by the time you
   reach the publication stage!), please cite:
   
    Vogt, *fcmaker: automating the creation of ESO-compliant finding charts for Observing 
    Blocks on p2*, Astronomy & Computing, 2018, 25, 81. `ADS entry <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....25...81V>`_
   
   In fact, a friendly nudge along the following blurb will give due credits to all those
   that made fcmaker possible in the first place::
   
    This research has made use of \textsc{fcmaker} (Vogt, 2018a,b), a \textsc{python} module 
    to create ESO-compliant finding charts for OBs on \textit{p2}. \textsc{fcmaker} relies 
    on \textsc{matplotlib} (Hunter 2007), \textsc{astropy}, a community-developed core 
    \textsc{python} package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2013, 2018), 
    \textsc{astroquery}, a package hosted at \url{https://astroquery.readthedocs.io} which 
    provides a set of tools for querying astronomical web forms and databases (Ginsburg et 
    al. 2017), \textsc{astroplan} (Morris et al. 2018), \textsc{aplpy}, an open-source 
    plotting package for \textsc{python} (Robitaille 2012), and \textsc{montage}, funded 
    by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number ACI-1440620 and previously funded 
    by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s Earth Science Technology Office, 
    Computation Technologies Project, under Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626 between 
    NASA and the California Institute of Technology. \textsc{fcmaker} uses the VizieR 
    catalogue access tool, CDS, Strasbourg, France. The original description of the VizieR 
    service was published in Ochsenbein (2000). \textsc{fcmaker} makes use of data from the 
    European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia (\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}), 
    processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, 
    \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium}). Funding for the DPAC has 
    been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating 
    in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement. In particular, \textsc{fcmaker} uses data from the 
    Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016) Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2018). 
    \textsc{fcmaker} also uses data from the Second Digitized Sky Survey (DSS 2). The 
    ``Second Epoch Survey'' of the southern sky was produced by the Anglo-Australian 
    Observatory (AAO) using the UK Schmidt Telescope. Plates from this survey have been 
    digitized and compressed by the STScI. The digitized images are copyright (c) 1993-1995 
    by the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. The ``Equatorial Red Atlas'' of the southern 
    sky was produced using the UK Schmidt Telescope. Plates from this survey have been 
    digitized and compressed by the STScI. The digitized images are copyright (c) 1992-1995, 
    jointly bythe UK SERC/PPARC (Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, formerly 
    Science and Engineering Research Council) and the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. 
    The compressed files of the ``Palomar Observatory - Space Telescope Science Institute 
    Digital Sky Survey'' of the northern sky, based on scans of the Second Palomar Sky 
    Survey, are copyright (c) 1993-1995 by the California Institute of Technology. All 
    DSS2 material not subject to one of the above copyright provisions is copyright(c) 
    1995 by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., produced under 
    Contract No. NAS 5-26555 with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

**Q: I don't have/don't want to install Montage. Can I still run fcmaker ?**

   A: Yes, simply use the ``--no-montage`` flag when calling fcmaker. But we still strongly recommend using Montage to have all the charts rotated North. 
         
**Q: I don't have/don't want to use my system-wide Latex. Can I still run fcmaker ?**

   **A**: Yes, simply use the ``--no-systemtex`` flag when calling fcmaker. But we still strongly recommend using a proper LaTeX setup to generate good-looking charts.

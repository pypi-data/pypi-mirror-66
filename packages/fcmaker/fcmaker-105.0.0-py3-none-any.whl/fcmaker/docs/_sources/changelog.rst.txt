==========

.. todo:: 
  
   - deal with DETECTOR offsets
   - find a better way to display the allowed TT area for MUSE ... 
     e.g. intersection of circles ?
   
   
v0.1.42 November 2017, F.P.A. Vogt:
 - in case of large blind offset, have a flexible zoom level in the left plot panel
 - added option to save to PDF in fcmaker_plots.make_fc() and __main__.py
 - fixed all docstrings in p2api.py
 - handle the orientation of custom background images by rotating the N-E arrows.
 - added a default "target" field for all MUSE WFM (AO) observations, because this is where
   the system first closes the AO loop (before applying any of the offset in the observing
   sequence). This allows the observer to check that the TTS are also valid in this position.
 - added legend to the charts
 - restructured the plotting to better separate instrument-specific elements from generic 
   ones. Created fcmaker_instrument_dispatch.py to that effect.
 - added support for OBs with multiple science templates
 - added the obId to chart

v0.1.41 November 2017, F.P.A. Vogt:
 - propagated the PA of the acquisition frame to the Science sequence (MUSE)
 - allowed to specify only 1 bk_image and bk_lams in automated mode

v0.1.40 October 2017, F.P.A. Vogt:
 - included doc in pypi package
 - updated doc

v0.1.26 October 2017, F.P.A. Vogt:

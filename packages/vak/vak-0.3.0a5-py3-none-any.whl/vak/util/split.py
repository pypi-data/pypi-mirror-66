    """return indices to split a dataset into training, test, and validation sets of specified durations.

    Given the durations of a set of vocalizations, and labels from the annotations for those vocalizations,
    this function returns arrays of indices for splitting up the set into training, test,
    and validation sets.

    Using those indices will produce datasets that each contain instances of all labels in the set of labels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    durs : iterable
        of float. Durations of audio files.
    labels : iterable
        of numpy arrays of str or int. Labels for segments (syllables, phonemes, etc.) in audio files.
    labelset : set, list
        set of unique labels for segments in files. Used to verify that each returned array
        of indices will produce a set that contains instances of all labels found in original
        set.
    train_dur : float
        Target duration for training set, in seconds.
    test_dur : float
        Target duration for test set, in seconds.
    val_dur : float
        Target duration for validation set, in seconds. Default is None.
        If None, no indices are returned for validation set.
    algo : str
        algorithm to use. One of {'brute_force', 'inc_freq'}. Default is 'brute_force'. For more information
        on the algorithms, see the docstrings, e.g., vak.io.splitalgos.brute_force
.
    Returns
    -------
    train_inds, test_inds, val_inds : numpy.ndarray
        indices to use with some array-like object to produce sets of specified durations

    Takes dataset represented as a pandas DataFrame and adds a 'split' column that assigns each

    Parameters
    ----------
    vak_df : pandas.Dataframe
        a dataset of vocalizations.
    labelset : set, list
        of str or int, set of labels for vocalizations.

    test_dur : float
        total duration of test set, in seconds. Default is None.
    val_dur : float
        total duration of validation set, in seconds. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    vak_df : pandas.Dataframe
        a copy of the input dataset with a 'split' column added,
        that assigns each vocalization (row) to a subset,
        i.e., train, validation, or test.
        If the vocalization was not added to one of the subsets,
        its value for 'split' will be 'None'.

    Notes
    -----
    uses the function `vak.dataset.split.train_test_dur_split_inds` to find indices for each subset.

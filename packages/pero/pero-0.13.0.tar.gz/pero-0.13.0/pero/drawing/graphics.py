    Properties:
        
        tag: str, callable, None or UNDEF
            Specifies the unique tag of the object. If not provided on a class
            initialization it is set automatically using object id. The value is
            often used as id when drawn to SVG or as object identifier in
            complex graphics like charts.
        
        visible: bool, callable
            Specifies whether the object should be drawn or skipped.
        
        z_index: int, float or UNDEF
            Specifies the object z-index. The value may be used to provide
            specific order for objects drawing in complex graphics like charts.
            Bigger the value is, more on top the graphics should be drawn. Any
            specific use of this must be implemented by a user to draw graphics
            in desired order.

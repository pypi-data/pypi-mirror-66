ronto
#####

*ronto* is a cli tool for building stuff using repotool, Yocto and Docker.

The *ronto* command is intended to simplify Yocto build environments and
processes.
It can be used by developers who just want to build a single
recipe.
It can also be used for headless CI builds or release builds covering a set of
machines and images.
All build activities can be transparently performed within a docker container
or on bare metal.

*ronto* is the proposed prefix for 10^-27 of something.
It is like Yocto which is the prefix for 10^-24 of something.

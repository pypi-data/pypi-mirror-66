✏️safer: a safer file opener ✏️
-------------------------------

No more partial writes or corruption!

Install ``safer`` from the command line with ``pip
<https://pypi.org/project/pip/>``_: ``pip install safer``.

Tested on Python 2.7, and 3.4 through 3.8.

``safer.open()``
=================

``safer.open()`` writes a whole file or nothing. It's a drop-in replacement for
built-in ``open()`` except that ``safer.open()`` leaves the original file
unchanged on failure.

EXAMPLE

.. code-block:: python

    # dangerous
    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

    # safer
    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.


``safer.open(filename)`` returns a file stream ``fp`` like ``open(filename)``
would, except that ``fp`` writes to a temporary file in the same directory.

If ``fp`` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then
``fp.safer_failed`` is automatically set to ``True``. And when ``fp.close()``
is called, the temporary file is moved over ``filename`` *unless*
``fp.safer_failed`` is true.

------------------------------------

``safer.printer()``
===================

``safer.printer()`` is similar to ``safer.open()`` except it yields a function
that prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.

Like ``safer.open()``, if an exception is raised within the context manager,
the original file is left unchanged.

EXAMPLE

.. code-block:: python

    # dangerous
    with open(file, 'w') as fp:
        for item in items:
            print(item, file=fp)
        # Prints lines until the first exception

    # safer
    with safer.printer(file) as print:
        for item in items:
            print(item)
        # Either the whole file is written, or nothing

NOTES
--------

If a stream ``fp`` return from ``safer.open()`` is used as a context manager
and an exception is raised, the property ``fp.safer_failed`` is set to
``True``.

In the method ``fp.close()``, if ``fp.safer_failed`` is *not* set, then the
temporary file is moved over the original file, successfully completing the
write.

If ``fp.safer_failed`` is true, then if ``delete_failures`` is true, the
temporary file is deleted.

If the ``mode`` argument contains either ``'a'`` (append), or ``'+'`` (update),
then the original file will be copied to the temporary file before writing
starts.

Note that ``safer`` uses an extra temporary file which is renamed over the file
only after the stream closes without failing.  This uses as much disk space as
the old and new files put together.

FUNCTIONS
---------

``safer.open(name, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, make_parents=False, delete_failures=True)``

    A drop-in replacement for ``open()`` which returns a stream which only
    overwrites the original file when close() is called, and only if there was no
    failure

``safer.printer(name, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, make_parents=False, delete_failures=True)``

    A context manager that yields a function that prints to the opened file,
    only overwriting the original file at the exit of the context,
    and only if there was no exception thrown

``safer.writer(name, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, make_parents=False, delete_failures=True)``

    (DEPRECATED) A shorthand for ``open(file, 'w')``


ARGUMENTS
  make_parents:
    If true, create the parent directory of the file if it doesn't exist

  delete_failures:
    If true, the temporary file is deleted if there is an exception

The remaining arguments are the same as for built-in ``open()``.

Description: # Facebook Page Poster
        Since Facebook blocked the apps to post on page, read more [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/).
        I need to use Selenium
        ## Linux
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * Gecko Driver for Firefox
        Download the selenium Driver for firefox [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
        
        ## Windows
        ### Prerequisites
         * Install [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/new/)
         * Install [Gecko Driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Windows
         * Extract geckodriver.zip and move the geckodriver.exe to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Gecko Driver` (probably you will need to create this folder)
        
        ### Facebook Credentials
        #### Set the facebook credentials:
          - Write on the file credentials.txt the email and password to log in (see the example file)
          ```
          <Email>
          <Password>
          ```
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        import FacebookPagePoster
        
        poster = FacebookPagePoster()
        poster.page_url = 'https://m.facebook.com/PAGE_URL/'
        poster.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL'
        poster.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
        poster.firing_up_driver()
        poster.sign_in()
        poster.post("YOUR MESSAGE")
        poster.delete("POST_ID")
        ```
        or you can use setup
        ```
        import FacebookPagePoster
        
        poster = FacebookPagePoster()
        
        poster.setup('PAGE_ID','YOUR_EMAIL','YOUR_PASSWORD')
        poster.post("YOUR MESSAGE")
        poster.delete("POST_ID")
        
        ```

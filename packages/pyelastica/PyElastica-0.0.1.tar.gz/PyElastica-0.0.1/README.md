![Build_status](https://travis-ci.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica.svg?branch=master)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GazzolaLab/PyElastica)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyelastica/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.cosseratrods.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)


PyElastica is the python implementation of **Elastica**, which is a *free* and *open-source* software project for the simulation of assemblies of slender, one-dimensional structures using Cosserat Rod theory. More information about Elastica and Cosserat rod theory is available at the Elastica [project website](https://cosseratrods.org)

The current version of PyElastica released here is the educational version. This version is a straight forward Python implementation of the Elastica code making heavy use of numpy. As such, it is very slow. We are working on a significantly accelerated Python version of the code that we hope to release soon.

## Installation 
The easiest way to install PyElastica is with PIP **(not yet implemented)**. PyElastica requires Python 3.7. 

~~~python
    pip install pyelastica 
~~~

## Documentation
Documentation of PyElastica is available at [docs.cosseratrods.org](https://docs.cosseratrods.org/)

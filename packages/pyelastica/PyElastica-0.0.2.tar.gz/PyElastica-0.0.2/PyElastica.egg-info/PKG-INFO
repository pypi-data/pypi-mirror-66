Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: PyElastica
Version: 0.0.2
Summary: Elastica is a software to simulate the dynamics of filaments that, at every cross-section, can undergo all six possible modes of deformation, allowing the filament to bend, twist, stretch and shear, while interacting with complex environments via muscular activity, surface contact, friction and hydrodynamics.

Description: 
        # PyElastica 
        ![Build_status](https://travis-ci.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica.svg?branch=master)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GazzolaLab/PyElastica)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyelastica/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.cosseratrods.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        
        PyElastica is the python implementation of **Elastica**, which is a *free* and *open-source* software project for the simulation of assemblies of slender, one-dimensional structures using Cosserat Rod theory. More information about Elastica and Cosserat rod theory is available at the Elastica [project website](https://cosseratrods.org)
        
        The current version of PyElastica released here is the educational version. This version is a straight forward Python implementation of the Elastica code making heavy use of numpy. As such, it is very slow. We are working on a significantly accelerated Python version of the code that we hope to release soon.
        
        ## Installation 
        PyElastica is compatible with Python 3.5 - 3.8. The easiest way to install PyElastica is with PIP. 
        
        ~~~python
            pip install pyelastica 
        ~~~

#       -hn or --max-back-scroll=n
#              Specifies  a  maximum number of lines to scroll backward.  If it
#              is necessary to scroll backward more than n lines, the screen is
#              repainted in a forward direction instead.  (If the terminal does
#              not have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)

# 'n' is pretty universal AND - usually isn't 2 characters (with a number of notable
# exceptions such as sendmail)

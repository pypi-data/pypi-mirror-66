Description: GeoTiler is a library to create maps using tiles from a map provider.
        
        The main goal of the library is to enable a programmer to create maps using
        tiles downloaded from OpenStreetMap, Stamen or other map provider.
        
        The maps can be used by interactive applications or to create data analysis
        graphs.
        
        The code is based on Python port of Modest Maps project [1][2], which is
        licensed under BSD license. All subsequent changes are licensed under GPL
        v3 license.

"""
Create an object containing a GeoTiler object and convert the resulting
image to an OpenCV image in order to show it. Also contains functions to
plot points on the resulting map.

Zooming is possible with the mousewheel and `+` and `-` keys.

Requirements

- geotiler
- opencv
- numpy (also required by OpenCV)

Example provided by `https://github.com/matthijs876`.

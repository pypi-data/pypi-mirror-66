# Congruous

A python CLI that generates performance and accuracy reports of your OCR recognized data with the human - curated correct data 

#### Installation 

 Works on python-3 environment and requires pip3 to install . In order to avoid environment conflicts setting up  [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is advisable.
```
$ pip install congruous
```



Just to confirm that congruous is installed correctly along with its dependency , run the          ```--version``` comand. 


```
$ congruous --version
```
 This command should show you  the lastest version number without any errors. However , its 
been reported that for some linux distribution ```python-tk``` is required to run this.  Run the below  command to fix it. 

```
$ apt-get install python-tk
```

#### Quick Start
```
$ congruous --help

Congruous mainly works based on the following three sub-commands , 
* ```store```
*  ```match```
*  ```report```

Currently supported document types : `pan` , ```aadhar```


 #### Command : ```store``` 


The purpose of ```store``` command  is to handle all the database operations.  The term ```store```  intends to  store something or to keep hold of .  Congruous uses an in-built sqlite database to handle the store operations .

Here are some of the options that can be used along with the ```store```  command. 

```--seed```  - feeds the database based on document type , prints number of records
 seeded if successful .


```--head``` - displays the first 10 records that were seeded during the seed operation. can be used to verify if your matching against the right set of data. 

```--tail``` -  displays the last 10 records that were seeded during the seed operation. can be used to verify if your matching against the right set of data. 

```--count``` - displays the total number of records seeded for a document type.

```--drop```  - drops all the records for a particular document type that was seeded .

 #### Command : ```match```

This command performs the match operation and gives the performance of the OCR . Match can be performed either against seeded records or with another file using the options below.  

 ```--ocrd``` -  mandatory field that passes custom built OCR parsed data as an input to the tool. By default it will be matched to seeded records

```--hcd``` - to match with a another file instead of the  seeded records  in stores . passes a file to the tool 

```--report``` - generates a report on the the given current run of the congruous .

#### Command : ```report```

This command is helpful to get insights about your OCR model performance over a period of time.  Right now it just displays  history - performance in the last few congruous runs . More options are to be included in the future versions

```--history```  -  displays the performance of you OCR for the last 10 runs.

Description: # IRReceiver
        *A module to parse the NEC IR remote control protocol in Python*
        
        ## Description
        This is a fully tested module that creates a receiver for the NEC IR remote control protocol.
        
        The NEC protocol is used by many remotes, you can read about it [here](https://www.sbprojects.net/knowledge/ir/nec.php).
        
        ## Dependencies
        - This project has no external dependencies but the example code does depend on a Raspberry Pi.
        
        ## Tested On
        - A Raspberry Pi (first generation)
        - A Yamaha MRX-90M remote
        
        ## To Build
        - Just include the file
        
        ## To Use
        - Look at the file `nec_example.py`. Essentially just call `decode` on an instance of `NecDecoder`

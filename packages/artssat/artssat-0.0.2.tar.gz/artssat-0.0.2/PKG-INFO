        # artssat
        
        artssat provides a high-level, object-oriented interface for the [Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator](https://www.radiativetransfer.org/). The aim of artssat is to provide a simpler and more modular way of performing radiative transfer simulations and in particular retrievals.
        
        As of now, artssat is only used for my own research on remote sensing retrievals but I hope to
        be able to expand its capabilities over time.

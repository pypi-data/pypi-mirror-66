# lsqfitgp

Module for manipulating gaussian processes. Features:

  * Use [gvar](https://github.com/gplepage/gvar) to keep track transparently of
    correlations between prior, data and posterior.

  * Fit a latent gaussian process in a nonlinear model with
    [lsqfit](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit).

  * [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd)-friendly.

  * Supports multidimensional structured non-numerical input with named
    dimensions.

  * Apply arbitrary linear transformations to the process.

  * Use dictionaries to manipulate hyperparameters and hyperpriors. Use
    `gvar.BufferDict` to transparently apply transformations.

  * Get a covariance matrix for the optimized hyperparameters.

## Installation

```
pip install lsqfitgp
```

## Examples

In the directory `examples` there are various scripts named with single letters
(sorry for this nonsense notation). In an IPython shell, you can run
`examples/RUNALL.ipy` to run all the examples and save the figures on files.

## Documentation

There's no manual, only docstrings in the code.

## Tests

The test code is in `tests`. Launch `pytest` in the repository to run all the
tests. `pytest` can be installed with `pip install pytest`.

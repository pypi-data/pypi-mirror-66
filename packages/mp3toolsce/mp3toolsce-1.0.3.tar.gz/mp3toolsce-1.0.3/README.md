# mp3-tools
Merge mp3 files and set correct audio length using foobar2000 with an automated python script. These scripts can merge all files in one directory or create one file for each subdirectory.


![merge mp3 files from subdirectories](https://github.com/carsten-engelke/mp3-tools/blob/master/mergemp3subdirs.jpg?raw=true)
 - merge-mp3.py: merging script, works with foobar2000
 - pack-subdirs.py: pack files into grouped subdirectories (good for large audiobooks)
 - unpack-subdirs.py: unpack files from grouped subdirectories (undo pack-subdirs.py)

## Version
1.0.0 release version. Ported to vscode.

0.2.0 bug corrected foobar needs to be called from working directory as the command line plugin cannot handle empty spaces in file names or paths given by command line

0.1.0 initial release. Port from windows script to python, introducing automation

## Requirements
- Python (script was created using python 3.7.0) (https://www.python.org/)

class CommandRunner(DnacApi):
    """
    The CommandRunner class provides the interface for running CLI commands on DNA Center.  Note that the command
    runner API only allows read-only commands, i.e. show commands.

    Command sets must be formatted as a dictionary with two lists.  The first item uses "commands" as its key and then
    has a list of the actual CLI commands to run.  The second value's key is "deviceUuids" and its values are the
    device IDs where the commands will be run. CommandRunner provides two functions to help produce the dictionary
    used as the API call's body: formatCmd and formatCmds.

    To execute the commands, CommandRunner provdes two different methods. run() issues the commands but does not wait
    for the task to complete. runSync() on the other hand, waits for the task to finish and then collects the results.

    Attributes:
        dnac: A pointer to the Dnac object containing the CommandRunner instance.

            default: none
            scope: protected
        name: A user-friendly name for accessing the CommandRunner object in a Dnac.api{}.
            type: str
            default: none
            scope: protected
        task: A Task object associated with the commands being run.
            type: Task object
            default: none
            scope: protected
        cmds: The CLI commands to be run on the target devices.
            type: dict
            default: none
            scope: public
        resource: The URI for running commands within Cisco DNAC.
            type: str
            default: Cisco DNA Center version dependent
            scope: protected
        verify: A flag indicating whether or not to verify Cisco DNA Center's certificate.
            type: bool
            default: False
            scope: protected
        timeout: The number of seconds to wait for Cisco DNAC to respond before timing out.
            type: int
            default: 5
            scope: protected

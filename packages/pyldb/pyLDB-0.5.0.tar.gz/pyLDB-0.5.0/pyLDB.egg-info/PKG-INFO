Description: A package which wraps some of the fiddly parts of downloading departure board data from the National Rail enquiries Darwin  / LDBWS service. This code uses the suds SOAP library and the Jinja2 templating library to allow you to input a three-letter station code and get back HTML departure board with configurable style and layout.

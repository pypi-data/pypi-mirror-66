Command-line tools for Trakt.tv.

**I've done my best to ensure there isn't any critical bugs in this application, but please ensure your Trakt.tv profile has been backed up before running any operations with this application.**

**If you are concerned about data-loss:** I would suggest reviewing the created backups yourself, they are simple JSON files that can be opened in any text editor. Backup files are structured exactly how they are returned from the Trakt.tv API.

**Note:** Only history from a backup can be applied to your profile currently. Support for applying collection, playback, ratings, and watchlist data from a backup has not been implemented yet.

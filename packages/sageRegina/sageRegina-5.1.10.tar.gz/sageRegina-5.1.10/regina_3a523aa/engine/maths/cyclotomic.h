/**
 * Represents an element of a cyclotomic field.
 *
 * The cyclotomic field of order \a n extends the rationals with a
 * primitive <i>n</i>th root of unity.  This is isomorphic to the
 * polynomial field <tt>ℚ[x]/Φ_n</tt>, where <tt>Φ_n</tt> is the <i>n</i>th
 * cyclotomic polynomial.
 *
 * Using this isomorphism, each element of the cyclotomic field can be
 * uniquely represented as a rational polynomial of degree strictly less than
 * <tt>deg(Φ_n) = φ(n)</tt>, where <tt>φ</tt> denotes Euler's totient function.
 * This class stores field elements using such a polynomial representation,
 * and does \e not store complex numbers directly.  If you require the
 * complex value of a field element (as a floating point approximation),
 * you can call evaluate().
 *
 * Each object of this class stores both the value of the field element
 * and the order \a n of the underlying field.  This means that you can
 * freely work with elements of different fields simultaneously, though of
 * course most operations (such as addition, multplication and so on)
 * require all operands to belong to the same field.
 *
 * This class requires that the order \a n is strictly positive.
 *
 * Although this class makes use of global data in its implementation, all
 * of its methods are thread-safe.

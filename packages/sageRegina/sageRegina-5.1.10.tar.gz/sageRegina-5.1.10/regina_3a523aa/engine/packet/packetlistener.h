/**
 * An object that can be registered to listen for packet events.
 *
 * A packet listener can be registered to listen for events on a
 * packet by calling Packet::listen().
 *
 * Each time that one of the events listed in this class occurs,
 * the packet will call the appropriate routine for all registered
 * packet listeners.
 *
 * These events come in future/past pairs: packetToBeChanged() and
 * packetWasChanged(), childToBeAdded() and childWasAdded(), and so on.
 * These event pairs are mutually exclusive: any event will
 * cause at most one pair of routines to be called for each
 * (packet, listener) pair.  For instance, if a packet is renamed then
 * packetToBeRenamed() and packetWasRenamed() will be called but
 * packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() will not.
 *
 * As a special case, when a packet is destroyed there is only the future
 * event packetToBeDestroyed() with no matching "past" event, since \e after
 * the packet has been destroyed the set of listeners is no longer available.
 *
 * No guarantees are made as to the order in which the different packet
 * listeners are notified of an event.
 *
 * When a listener is destroyed, it is automatically unregistered
 * from any packets to which it is currently listening.  Similarly, when
 * a packet is destroyed all listeners are automatically unregistered.
 *
 * \warning At the time of writing (admittedly long ago now), Qt has only
 * limited support for multithreading.  When working with an existing packet
 * tree in a new thread (not the main thread), the \e only modification that
 * you may make is to insert new packets.  Modifications of any other type
 * (such as changing, renaming, deleting or reordering existing packets)
 * could lead to a crash within Qt or Xlib when running the GUI.
 * Of course, a new thread may create, modify and delete its own temporary
 * packet trees as it chooses (and it may in fact insert them into a
 * pre-existing packet tree once all modifications are completed).
 * Assuming these restrictions are respected, packet listeners may assume
 * that no routines other than childWasAdded() will be called from a non-main
 * thread.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.

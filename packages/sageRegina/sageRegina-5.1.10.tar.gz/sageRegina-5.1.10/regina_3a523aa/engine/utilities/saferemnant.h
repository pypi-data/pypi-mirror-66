 * The pointee in turn derives from SafePointeeBase.
 *
 * Each remnant is associated with at most one pointee, and each pointee
 * is associated with at most one remnant.  However, both relationships
 * are optional:
 *
 * - a remnant will have no corresponding pointee if its original pointee
 *   has since been destroyed;
 *
 * - a pointee will have no corresponding remnant if there are no SafePtr
 *   pointers that point to it.
 *
 * The lifetime of a remnant is tied to the existence of SafePtr objects
 * that point to it (through reference counting), not to that of the
 * corresponding pointee.
 *
 * \tparam T the pointee type.  This must derive from SafePointeeBase<T>.

/**
 * A reference counted smart pointer that supports alternate models of
 * ownership.  Specifically, there are two models of ownership for the
 * pointee (of type \a T):
 *
 * 1. The pointee may be owned by the smart pointer(s), in which
 *    case it will be destroyed when the last smart pointer to it is destroyed.
 * 2. Alternatively, the pointee may be owned by some other C++ object not
 *    using this smart pointer class.  In this case, even when the last smart
 *    point to it is destroyed, the pointee itself will not be destroyed.
 *
 * The pointee can indicate at runtime which model of ownership is in effect,
 * through the return value of the function T::hasOwner().
 *
 * The requirements for the pointee type \a T are as follows:
 *
 * - \a T must subclass from \c SafePointeeBase<T>.
 * - \a T must implement a member function <tt>bool hasOwner()</tt>,
 *   which returns \c true if and only if some other C++ object (which is
 *   not a SafePtr) owns the pointee.
 *
 * Destruction works as follows:
 *
 * - If a pointee's destructor is called, all SafePtr pointers that point to it
 *   will become expired.  These SafePtr pointers are still safe to use, but
 *   get() will return \c null.
 * - If a pointee has one or more SafePtr pointers to it, then when the last
 *   of these safe pointers is destroyed, the pointee itself will be destroyed
 *   if and only if the pointee's hasOwner() returns \c false.
 *
 * Under the hood, SafePtr uses SafeRemnant to achieve this.

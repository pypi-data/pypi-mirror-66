 * A base class for objects of type \a T to be referenceable by a SafePtr.
 * Such objects are referred to as pointees of SafePtr.
 *
 * The class \a T must derive from SafePointeeBase<T>, and must implement
 * hasOwner() to indicate whether any non-SafePtr claims ownership of it.
 * Details of ownership semantics (and in particular, the requirements for
 * hasOwner()) are explained in the documentation for SafePtr.
 *
 * The overhead introduced by subclassing from SafePointeeBase without using
 * the features of the accompanying smart pointer SafePtr are minimal:
 * one extra pointer that needs to be zeroed upon construction.
 *
 * Regina's classes that derive from SafePointeeBase do so to help with
 * python wrapping.
 *
 * \tparam T the type of object being pointed to.  This must derive from
 * SafePointeeBase<T>.

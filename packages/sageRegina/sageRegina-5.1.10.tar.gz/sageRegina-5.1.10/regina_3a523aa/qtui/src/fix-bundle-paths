# Fixes Regina's MacOS app bundle to use @loader_path instead of
# @executable_path when linking against other shared libraries inside
# the app bundle.
#
# This is important if, for instance, we wish to be able to load Regina's
# python module from a different python session (e.g., SnapPy).
#
#
# Usage: fix-bundle-paths <bundle_dir>

## BIP158

This implements the compact block filter construction in BIP 158. The code is not used anywhere in the Bitcoin Core code base yet. The next step towards BIP 157 support would be to create an indexing module similar to TxIndex that constructs the basic and extended filters for each validated block.

### Install

```bash
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip3 install .
```

### Run python tests

```bash
python3 tests/simple_test.py
```

### Installation steps on a fresh OSX image

Install brew:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew install python3  
brew install boost  

At this point the only error is canâ€™t find boost_thread lib

The issue is the homebrew boost shipsÂ libboost_thread-mtÂ libs but doesnâ€™t include plainÂ libboost_thread, so clang canâ€™t find it. Interestingly, homebrew boost does have both plain andÂ -mtÂ files for theÂ libboost_systemÂ libraries.

$ find /usr/local/lib/ | grep boost_thread  
libboost_thread-mt.a  
libboost_thread-mt.dylib  

Solution, with no guarantees that this is "the Right Way to do things", but appears to work fine for the configure stage:

$ cd /usr/local/lib  
$ ln -s libboost_thread-mt.a libboost_thread.a  
$ ln -s libboost_thread-mt.dylib libboost_thread.dylib

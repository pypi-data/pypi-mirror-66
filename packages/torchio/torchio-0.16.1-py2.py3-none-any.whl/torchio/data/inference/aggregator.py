class GridAggregator:
    r"""Aggregate patches for dense inference.

    This class is typically used to build a volume made of batches after
    inference of patches coming from a
    :py:class:`~torchio.data.inference.grid_sampler.GridSampler`.

    Adapted from NiftyNet. See
    `this NiftyNet tutorial <https://niftynet.readthedocs.io/en/dev/window_sizes.html>`_
    for more information.

    Args:
        data: Tensor from which patches were extracted.
        patch_overlap: Tuple of integers :math:`(d_o, h_o, w_o)` specifying the
            overlap between patches. If a single number
            :math:`n` is provided, :math:`d_o = h_o = w_o = n`.

    .. note:: In the future, the :py:attr:`data` argument will be replaced by
        :py:attr:`shape`.

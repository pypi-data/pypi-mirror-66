Python Wrapper to interface with various databases.

Description
===========

Forget about boiler plate code to setup and tear database connections:
This library will give you all the basic methods to pull and push data from various types of database
Initial release will support Postgres and Mysql.
I will focus on python 3.7 just to discourage people from continuing the python 2.7 train.
Move to 3.6+ and get learn something new.

Get the programmer out of worrying about how to connect to and manage a database connection.
Start using it.

Install jaydebeapi if you need to mess with JAVA JDBC

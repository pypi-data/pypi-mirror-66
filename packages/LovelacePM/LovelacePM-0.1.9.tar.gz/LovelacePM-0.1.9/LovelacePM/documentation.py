returns alphas, Cls, Cds, Cms arrays for Xfoil-calculated polar. Airfoil is searched for (with .dat extension if ext_apped==True) in afldir directory, or current directory if it is of length 0. 
Elements of aseq list should be, respectively, first angle of attack, last angle of attack and desired step in AOAs for polar composition. 
visc==True sets Reynolds number to kwarg Re. M sets Mach number. iter kwarg sets maximum number of iterations for quasi-simultaneous viscid inviscid coupling. 
flap, if present, defines a length=3 list with, respectively, the x-axis chord percentage for the flap\'s axis, the thickness percentage for the
given axis and its deflection in degrees. npan and LE_con are, respectively, the number of panels to be used for Xfoil\'s panel method and their concentration in the leading edge.
Chosen angles of attack are inverted (for horizontal tails and likewise inverted airfoil surfaces) if inverse is True.

WARNING: aseq and iter kwargs may have to be changed to obtain better polars. Non-converged AOAs are not returned: check alphas array in returned values to detect converged angles of attack'''

xfoil_visc.polar_correction.__doc__='''
Class containing information on a given viscous polar obtained from Xfoil.

WARNING: not all polars obtained from Xfoil can be readily used, for unconvergence of its quasi-simultaneous viscous-inviscid coupling method may compromise some of the returned AOAs, which are
made unavailable for use by this class. It is advisable that viscous polars are created separately from other aircraft analysis scripts, saved using polar_correction.dump() method and loaded for
aircraft analysis using function xfoil_visc.read_polar()

WARNING: polars are linearly interpolated between available calculated Reynolds numbers so as to fit other Reynolds intervals. Re_high and Re_low variables must be set so as to achieve maximum precision
with this interpolation

.plr file structure:
[first line with number of inviscid polar lines]
Inviscid polar with alpha, Cl, Cd and Cm information, respectively, in four columns for all calculated AOAs
[arbitrary low Reynolds number value for polar, separated by simple spacing from number of collected AOAs for the chosen low Reynolds number]
Low Reynolds viscous polar with alpha, Cl, Cd and Cm information, respectively, in four columns for all calculated AOAs

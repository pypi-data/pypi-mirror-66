Description: # shournal-to-snakemake
        
        Transform a command series observed by 
        [shournal](https://github.com/tycho-kirchner/shournal)
         to 
        [snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake)
         rules.
        
        [shournal](https://github.com/tycho-kirchner/shournal) 
        tracks read and written files of shell commands. Thus, for
        each command the input- and output-section of a snakemake rule 
        may be generated. Matched file-paths are automatically replaced
        in the command string with {input} and {output}.
        
        
        ## Basic Usage
        After 
        [shournal](https://github.com/tycho-kirchner/shournal)
        is installed, start a new (by shournal observed) shell session. Within that
        perform the (shell-based) data analysis of your choice. 
        
        Once done, from within the same shell-session, generate the snakemake rules by
        
        ```
        shournal -q --output-format json -sid $SHOURNAL_SESSION_ID | shournal-to-snakemake
        ```
        
        ## Toy example
        ```
        $ SHOURNAL_ENABLE
        $ echo stuff > foo
        $ cat foo > bar
        $ shournal -q --output-format json -sid $SHOURNAL_SESSION_ID | shournal-to-snakemake
        rule undefined_1:
            output:
                "foo",
            shell:
                # raw: echo stuff > foo
                "echo stuff > {output}"
        
        
        rule undefined_2:
            input:
                "foo",
            output:
                "bar",
            shell:
                # raw: cat foo > bar
                "cat {input} > {output}"
        ```
        
        ## General hints
        * Don't change the working directory during the workflow.
        * Do not use wildcards or variables (in file-paths), otherwise the files
          in the command string cannot be correctly replaced by {input} or {output}.
        * Stick to basic posix shell syntax
          
        
        ## Installation
        Create a wheel directly from source by executing
        ```
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        Install the wheel as usual, e.g. by
        ```
        pip3 install --user dist/shournal_to_snakemake-VERSION-*.whl
        ```
